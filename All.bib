abstract = {There is significant interest in quantifying force production inside cells, but since conditions in vivo are less well controlled than those in vitro, in vivo measurements are challenging. In particular, the in vivo environment may vary locally as far as its optical properties, and the organelles manipulated by the optical trap frequently vary in size and shape. Several methods have been proposed to overcome these difficulties. We evaluate the relative merits of these methods and directly compare two of them, a refractive index matching method, and a light-momentum-change method. Since in vivo forces are frequently relatively high (e.g., can exceed 15 pN for lipid droplets), a high-power laser is employed. We discover that this high-powered trap induces local temperature changes, and we develop an approach to compensate for uncertainties in the magnitude of applied force due to such temperature variations.},

abstract = {Recent advances and interest in ultrasound manipulation of particles at the microscale calls for an increased theoretical understanding of acoustofluidics including the thermoviscous effects of viscosity and heat-conduction, which lead to viscous and thermal boundary layers at interfaces between materials with different thermoacoustic properties. In this thesis we study acoustofluidics at the microscale under the unifying theme of thermoviscous effects . We present a mathematical theory of thermoviscous acoustofluidics describing acoustic wave propagation in a viscous, heat-conducting, Newtonian fluid. The acoustic wave propagation is described in terms of a longitudinal propagating compres- sional mode, a highly damped longitudinal thermal mode, and a highly damped transverse shear mode. The theory is applied to obtain a resonant field solution to the driven parallel- plate system correct to first order in k 0 $\delta$ s , where k 0 = 2 $\pi$/$\lambda$ is the wavenumber and $\delta$ s is the viscous boundary layer thickness. The theory represents an improvement over the commonly employed Prandtl-Schlichting boundary layer theory approach that is zeroth order in k 0 $\delta$ s . As a consequence, we are able to explain features of numerical solutions not previously accounted for. The complete description of the fields moreover allows for calculation of several quantities related to microchannel acoustofluidics such as the quality- factor of the resonance, which explains experimentally measured values around 500 as a consequence of viscous and thermal dissipation in the boundary layers near the walls. The thermoviscous theory of acoustics is applied to the problem of scattering of sound from particles much smaller than the acoustic wavelength, and we present analytical re- sults for the radiation force on a particle in an acoustical field, with no restrictions on the length scales of the viscous and thermal boundary layer thicknesses $\delta$ s and $\delta$ t relative to the particle radius a , i.e., in the limit of $\delta$ s ∼ $\delta$ t ∼ a  $\lambda$ . This is the limit rele- vant to scattering of ultrasound waves from micrometer-sized particles. For the case of a typical vegetable oil droplet in water we find corrections to the acoustic radiation force of more than 100{\%} due to thermal effects. With much ongoing experimental research in acoustofluidics aiming at focusing submicrometer-sized particles such as bacteria and vira, the corrections are interesting not only theoretically, but also from an engineering perspective.},

abstract = {We propose a technique based on pulsed ultrasounds for controlling, reducing to a minimum observable value the acoustic streaming in closed ultrasonic standing wave fluidic resonators. By modifying the number of pulses and the repetition time it is possible to reduce the velocity of the acoustic streaming with respect to the velocity generated by the continuous ultrasound mode of operation. The acoustic streaming is observed at the nodal plane where a suspension of 800nm latex particles was focused by primary radiation force. A mixture of 800nm and 15$\mu$m latex particles has been also used for showing that the acoustic streaming is hardly reduced while primary and secondary forces continue to operate. The parameter we call “pulse mode factor” i.e. the time of applied ultrasound divided by the duty cycle, is found to be the adequate parameter that controls the acoustic streaming. We demonstrate that pulsed ultrasound is more efficient for controlling the acoustic streaming than the variation of the amplitude of the standing waves.},

abstract = {Theories for calculating steady streaming associated with sound fields are reviewed, comparing the methods and approximations of various authors. Two illustrative problems are worked out, both for rectilinear flow due to irrotational sound fields. The first deals with a single attenuated plane wave traveling down a tube, as in Cady's quartz wind experiments. In the second, a pair of crossed plane waves is treated, giving rise to a quite different kind of streaming. In obtaining solutions, attention is given to boundary conditions; here, gradients of She excess static pressure, another second‐order quantity, come into consideration. Significantly, streaming speeds depend critically upon $\alpha$, the attenuation constant, where $\alpha$ may be due to any common cause, such as heat conduction, scattering, thermal relaxation, etc. From these results it appears that streaming measurements cannot be used to distinguish between absorption mechanisms. Numerical values are given for a few cases; high flow speeds may be expecte...},

Strong bands were found in the 1.6 and 2.3 regions. The fine structure of the 2.3 band was resolved in the first order spectrum. The fine structure of the 1.6 band was resolved in the second order but not in the first order spectrum. Only at the 2.20 and the 1.66 bands could the fine structure be measured. The 2.20 band has spacing of 10.7 cm-1, giving for the value of the moment of inertia 5.17×10-40 c.g.s. units. The corresponding values for the 1.66 band are 10.4 cm-1 and 5.32×10-40 c.g.s. units.

Here, we present an improved version of a single-cell printer which is able to deliver individual single cells and beads encapsulated in free-flying picoliter droplets at a single-bead efficiency of 96{\%} and with a throughput of more than 10 beads per minute. By integration of acoustophoretic focusing, the cells could be focused in x and y direction. This way, the cells were lined-up in front of a 40 $\mu$m nozzle, where they were analyzed individually by an optical system prior to printing. In agreement with acoustic simulations, the focusing of 10 $\mu$m beads and Raji cells has been achieved with an efficiency of 99{\%} (beads) and 86{\%} (Raji cells) to a 40 $\mu$m wide center region in the 1 mm wide microfluidic channel.

It is found that the solid-state thermal conductivity of amorphous silica nanoparticles is size-dependent and can be quantitatively calculated by using a phenomenological theory. The observed size effect on thermal conductivity of silica nanoparticles is however not significant, mostly due to the very small phonon mean free path of amorphous silica, l0 = 0.59 nm. It is also found that the phonon-defect scattering at the nanoparticle surfaces has a predominate effect on the involved heat transfer process. The calculated thermal conductivity of 5-nm silica nanoparticles is about 0.539 W/(mK).},

abstract = {A novel on-the-fly calibration method of optical tweezers is presented, which enables in situ control and measure of absolute temperature and viscosity at nanoscale dimensions. Such noncontact measurement and control at the nanoscale are challenging as the present techniques only provide off-line measurements that do not provide absolute values. Additionally, some of the present methods have a low spatial resolution. We simultaneously apply the high temporal sensitivity of position autocorrelation and equipartition theorem to precisely measure and control in situ temperature and the corresponding microrheological property around the focal volume of the trap at high spatial resolution. The femtosecond optical tweezers (FOTs) use a single-beam high repetition rate laser for optical trapping to result in finer temperature gradients in comparison to the continuous-wave laser tweezers. Such finer temperature gradients are due to the additional nonlinear optical (NLO) phenomena occurring only at the nanoscale focal plane of the FOTs. Because NLO processes are laser peak power-dependent, they promote an effective study of physical properties occurring only at the focal plane. Using FOTs at optically benign near-infrared wavelengths, we demonstrate microrheological control and measurement in water by adding a highly absorbing yet low fluorescent dye (IR780).},

abstract = {Neuroinflammation plays a central role in the progression of many neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, and challenges remain in modeling the complex pathological or physiological processes. Here, we report an acoustofluidic method that can rapidly construct 3D neurospheroids and inflammatory microenvironments for modeling microglia-mediated neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease. By incorporating a unique contactless and label-free acoustic assembly, this cell culture platform can assemble dissociated embryonic mouse brain cells into hundreds of uniform 3D neurospheroids with controlled cell numbers, composition (e.g. neurons, astrocytes, and microglia), and environmental components (e.g. amyloid-$\beta$ aggregates) in hydrogel within minutes. Moreover, this platform can maintain and monitor the interaction among neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and amyloid-$\beta$ aggregates in real-time for several days to weeks, after the integration of a high-throughput, time-lapse cell imaging approach. We demonstrated that our engineered 3D neurospheroids can represent the amyloid-$\beta$ neurotoxicity, which is one of the main pathological features of Alzheimer's disease. Using this method, we also investigated the microglia migratory behaviors and activation in the engineered 3D inflammatory microenvironment at a high throughput manner, which is not easy to achieve in 2D neuronal cultures or animal models. Along with the simple fabrication and setup, the acoustofluidic technology is compatible with conventional Petri dishes and well-plates, supports the fine-tuning of the cellular and environmental components of 3D neurospheroids, and enables the high-throughput cellular interaction investigation. We believe our technology may be widely used to facilitate 3D in vitro brain models for modeling neurodegenerative diseases, discovering new drugs, and testing neurotoxicity.},

We employ pulsed focussed surface acoustic waves (SAW) to eject droplets from an enclosed microfluidic channel into an open environment. The 3D position of individual droplets and their time of arrival can be precisely controlled to within 61 $\mu$s in a 500 $\mu$m square target region 40 $\mu$m wide. The continuous ejection rate of 16 000 droplets per second can be tuned to produce pulsed trains of droplets from 0 up to 357 Hz. The main benefit of this technique is its ease of integration with complex microfluidic processing steps, such as droplet merging, sorting, and encapsulation, prior to sample delivery. With its ability to precisely deliver a small quantity of fluid to a pre-defined location this technology is applicable in X-ray based molecular studies, including the rapidly expanding field of X-ray free electron lasers.

abstract = {Piezoelectric materials characterization is a challenging problem involving physical concepts, electrical and mechanical measurements and numerical optimization techniques. Piezoelectric ceramics such as Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT) belong to the 6 mm symmetry class, which requires five elastic, three piezoelectric and two dielectric constants to fully represent the material properties. If losses are considered, the material properties can be represented by complex numbers. In this case, 20 independent material constants are required to obtain the full model. Several numerical methods have been used to adjust the theoretical models to the experimental results. The continuous improvement of the computer processing ability has allowed the use of a specific numerical method, the Finite Element Method (FEM), to iteratively solve the problem of finding the piezoelectric constants. This review presents the recent advances in the numerical characterization of 6 mm piezoelectric materials from experimental electrical impedance curves. The basic strategy consists in measuring the electrical impedance curve of a piezoelectric disk, and then combining the Finite Element Method with an iterative algorithm to find a set of material properties that minimizes the difference between the numerical impedance curve and the experimental one. Different methods to validate the results are also discussed. Examples of characterization of some common piezoelectric ceramics are presented to show the practical application of the described methods.},

abstract = {Although frequent reference is made to acoustic radiation pressure in treatises and memoirs on sound, there appears to be no systematic theoretical development of the subject enabling actual pressures on obstacles of simple geometrical form to be calculated. In the audible range of acoustic frequencies, it is possible to devise, in a number of ways, means of measuring pressure amplitudes in sound waves as first order effects. At supersonic frequencies, however, these methods are no longer serviceable. When the dimensions of resonators of diaphragms become comparable with the wave-length, the physical effects which enable the pressure amplitude to be measured involve intractable diffraction problems, while the extremely high frequencies and small amplitudes involved make the employment of stroboscopic methods of observation extremely difficult. It has been shown, however, that at supersonic frequencies the acoustic radiation pressures on spheres and discs become sufficiently large to be measured easily, at any rate, in liquids. The mean pressure is generally assumed to be proportional to the energy density in the neighbourhood of the obstacle, and on this basis relative measurements can be made, for instance, in the radiation field of a supersonic oscillator. Such formul{\ae} may be obtained without restriction as to wave-length, for spheres in plane progressive and stationary radiation fields, and the magnitude of the pressure is found to be of entirely different orders of magnitude in the two cases.},

abstract = {The effect of acoustic streaming produced by sharp-edge structures is used in a variety of microfluidic applications, such as fluid mixing, pumping and particle manipulation. Since most investigations into this effect are experimental, there is a necessity in theoretical studies that could provide a deeper insight into the mechanism of the acoustic streaming and point out ways for optimizing acoustofluidic sharp-edge-based devices. In the present study, an analytical theory is developed that allows one to evaluate the velocity field of acoustic streaming generated at the apex of a wedge-shaped structure. Streamline patterns calculated by the developed theory show that the acoustic streaming is formed by two counterrotating vortices at the wedge apex. In addition to the analytical model, a numerical model is realized using the finite element method. Predictions of both models are described and compared with experimental observations.},

abstract = {In an optical tweezers experiment intense laser light is tightly focused to intensities of MW/cm(2) in order to apply forces to submicron particles or to measure mechanical properties of macromolecules. It is important to quantify potentially harmful or misleading heating effects due to the high light intensities in biophysical experiments. We present a model that incorporates the geometry of the experiment in a physically correct manner, including heat generation by light absorption in the neighborhood of the focus, balanced by outward heat flow, and heat sinking by the glass surfaces of the sample chamber. This is in contrast to the earlier simple models assuming heat generation in the trapped particle only. We find that in the most common experimental circumstances, using micron-sized polystyrene or silica beads, absorption of the laser light in the solvent around the trapped particle, not in the particle itself, is the most important contribution to heating. To validate our model we measured the spectrum of the Brownian motion of trapped beads in water and in glycerol as a function of the trapping laser intensity. Heating both increases the thermal motion of the bead and decreases the viscosity of the medium. We measured that the temperature in the focus increased by 34.2 +/- 0.1 K/W with 1064-nm laser light for 2200-nm-diameter polystyrene beads in glycerol, 43.8 +/- 2.2 K/W for 840-nm polystyrene beads in glycerol, 41.1 +/- 0.7 K/W for 502-nm polystyrene beads in glycerol, and 7.7 +/- 1.2 K/W for 500-nm silica beads and 8.1 +/- 2.1 K/W for 444-nm silica beads in water. Furthermore, we observed that in glycerol the heating effect increased when the bead was trapped further away from the cover glass/glycerol interface as predicted by the model. We show that even though the heating effect in water is rather small it can have non-negligible effects on trap calibration in typical biophysical experimental circumstances and should be taken into consideration when laser powers of more than 100 mW are used.},

The absorption spectra from the composites were measured using a spectrophotometer. The analysis of the optical results showed that the electronic transitions are direct in the k-space. The optical energy gap and the energy tails were determined as a function of iron particles' content. It was found that optical energy gap decreased and energy tails increased with iron content. The determined refractive index (n) and the extinction coefficient (k) increased with iron concentration. The alternating current (AC) conductivity and dielectric properties were determined using impedance measurements. The collected impedance data were analyzed and showed that the dielectric constant ($\epsilon$') and dielectric loss ($\epsilon$'') of the composites are increasing as iron concentration increases and decreasing as the applied frequency increases. It was found that the AC conductivity increases with increasing frequency, temperature, and iron concentration. Some theoretical and empirical models are used to describe the observed optical and electrical behavior of the prepared PS composites.},

Both are associated with flows that are dominated by their fluctuating components, and owe their origin to the action of Reynolds stresses. In the former, these stresses arise within the main body of the fluid when an ultrasonic beam propagates into it; in the latter they act in the Stokes shear-wave layer that forms at a solid boundary in a fluctuating flow. In spite of its acoustic origins, we show that streaming of the Rayleigh type is a phenomenon that occurs more widely than those origins suggest.},

These forces are calculated numerically in two steps. First, the thermoacoustic equations are solved to first order in the imposed ultrasound field taking into account the micrometer-thin but crucial thermoviscous boundary layer near the rigid walls. Second, the products of the resulting first-order fields are used as source terms in the time-averaged second-order equations, from which the net acoustic forces acting on the particles are determined. The resulting acoustophoretic particle velocities are quantified for experimentally relevant parameters using a numerical particle-tracking scheme. The model shows the transition in the acoustophoretic particle motion from being dominated by streaming-induced drag to being dominated by radiation forces as a function of particle size, channel geometry, and material properties. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract = {The confinement of liposomes and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells by infrared (IR) optical tweezers is shown to result in sample heating and temperature increases by several degrees centigrade, as measured by a noninvasive, spatially resolved fluorescence detection technique. For micron-sized spherical liposome vesicles having bilayer membranes composed of the phospholipid 1,2-diacyl-pentadecanoyl-glycero-phosphocholine (15-OPC), a temperature rise of approximately 1.45 +/- 0.15 degrees C/100 mW is observed when the vesicles are held stationary with a 1.064 microns optical tweezers having a power density of approximately 10(7) W/cm2 and a focused spot size of approximately 0.8 micron. The increase in sample temperature is found to scale linearly with applied optical power in the 40 to 250 mW range. Under the same trapping conditions, CHO cells exhibit an average temperature rise of nearly 1.15 +/- 0.25 degrees C/100 mW. The extent of cell heating induced by infrared tweezers confinement can be described by a heat conduction model that accounts for the absorption of infrared (IR) laser radiation in the aqueous cell core and membrane regions, respectively. The observed results are relevant to the assessment of the noninvasive nature of infrared trapping beams in micromanipulation applications and cell physiological studies.},

abstract = {Handling of sub-micrometer bioparticles such as bacteria are becoming increasingly important in the biomedical field and in environmental and food analysis. As a result, there is an increased need for less labor-intensive and time-consuming handling methods. Here, an acoustophoresis-based microfluidic chip that uses ultrasound to focus sub-micrometer particles and bacteria, is presented. The ability to focus sub-micrometer bioparticles in a standing one-dimensional acoustic wave is generally limited by the acoustic-streaming-induced drag force, which becomes increasingly significant the smaller the particles are. By using two-dimensional acoustic focusing, i.e. focusing of the sub-micrometer particles both horizontally and vertically in the cross section of a microchannel, the acoustic streaming velocity field can be altered to allow focusing. Here, the focusability of E. coli and polystyrene particles as small as 0.5 $\mu$m in diameter in microchannels of square or rectangular cross sections, is demonstrated. Numerical analysis was used to determine generic transverse particle trajectories in the channels, which revealed spiral-shaped trajectories of the sub-micrometer particles towards the center of the microchannel; this was also confirmed by experimental observations. The ability to focus and enrich bacteria and other sub-micrometer bioparticles using acoustophoresis opens the research field to new microbiological applications.},

In this article we present a route that determines temperature at the nano- to microscale with three independent measurements performed on a single trapped, rotating luminescent microparticle. We measure temperature changes using both the internal and external degrees of freedom, via (i) the upconverted luminescence, (ii) the rotation rate, and (iii) the Brownian dynamics of the particle. This novel tripartite approach allows us to cross-correlate the temperature for both the internal and external (center-of-mass) degree of freedom for the particle. In addition, our approach provides a measure of the temperature increase without the need of a precise knowledge of the particle dimensions, shape, or any previous calibration of the sample or the experimental setup. The developed technique opens up prospects for stringent tests of nanothermometry.},

abstract = {Techniques that can dexterously manipulate single particles, cells, and organisms are invaluable for many applications in biology, chemistry, engineering, and physics. Here, we demonstrate standing surface acoustic wave based "acoustic tweezers" that can trap and manipulate single microparticles, cells, and entire organisms (i.e., Caenorhabditis elegans) in a single-layer microfluidic chip. Our acoustic tweezers utilize the wide resonance band of chirped interdigital transducers to achieve real-time control of a standing surface acoustic wave field, which enables flexible manipulation of most known microparticles. The power density required by our acoustic device is significantly lower than its optical counterparts (10,000,000 times less than optical tweezers and 100 times less than optoelectronic tweezers), which renders the technique more biocompatible and amenable to miniaturization. Cell-viability tests were conducted to verify the tweezers' compatibility with biological objects. With its advantages in biocompatibility, miniaturization, and versatility, the acoustic tweezers presented here will become a powerful tool for many disciplines of science and engineering.},

Even though, on-chip sample processing and analysis has been rapidly developing for a wide range of screening and diagnostic protocols, efficient and reliable fluid manipulation in microfluidic platforms still require further developments to be considered portable and accessible for low-resource settings. In this work, we present an extremely simple microfluidic pumping device based on three-dimensional (3D) printing and acoustofluidics. The fabrication of the device only requires 3D-printed adaptors, rectangular glass capillaries, epoxy and a piezoelectric transducer. The pumping mechanism relies on the flexibility and complexity of the acoustic streaming patterns generated inside the capillary. Characterization of the device yields controllable and continuous flow rates suitable for on-chip sample processing and analysis. Overall, a maximum flow rate of {\~{}} 12 $\mu$L/min and the control of pumping direction by frequency tuning is achieved. With its versatility and simplicity, this microfluidic pumping device offers a promising solution for portable, affordable and reliable fluid manipulation for on-chip applications.},

These forces are calculated numerically in two steps. First, the thermoacoustic equations are solved to first order in the imposed ultrasound field taking into account the micrometer-thin but crucial thermoviscous boundary layer near the rigid walls. Second, the products of the resulting first-order fields are used as source terms in the time-averaged second-order equations, from which the net acoustic forces acting on the particles are determined. The resulting acoustophoretic particle velocities are quantified for experimentally relevant parameters using a numerical particle-tracking scheme. The model shows the transition in the acoustophoretic particle motion from being dominated by streaming-induced drag to being dominated by radiation forces as a function of particle size, channel geometry, and material properties.},

abstract = {The acoustic radiation pressure exerted by an axisymmetric sound field on a rigid sphere suspended freely in a viscous fluid is calculated, the sphere being considered as having an arbitrary radius relative to the sound and viscous wavelengths. The limiting cases of special interest are then investigated, namely, the acoustic radiation force due to a plane progressive and plane standing wave is examined for the limiting cases when the sound wavelength is much more than both the sphere radius and the viscous wavelength and the sphere radius is, in its turn, small or large compared with the viscous wavelength. It is shown that the influence of the viscosity of the fluid surrounding the sphere on the radiation force can be quite considerable in both a quantitative and a qualitative sense. The case of a fastened sphere is also considered.},

abstract = {The confinement of liposomes and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells by infrared (IR) optical tweezers is shown to result in sample heating and temperature increases by several degrees centigrade, as measured by a noninvasive, spatially resolved fluorescence detection technique. For micron-sized spherical liposome vesicles having bilayer membranes composed of the phospholipid 1,2-diacyl-pentadecanoyl-glycero-phosphocholine (15-OPC), a temperature rise of approximately 1.45 +/- 0.15 degrees C/100 mW is observed when the vesicles are held stationary with a 1.064 microns optical tweezers having a power density of approximately 10(7) W/cm2 and a focused spot size of approximately 0.8 micron. The increase in sample temperature is found to scale linearly with applied optical power in the 40 to 250 mW range. Under the same trapping conditions, CHO cells exhibit an average temperature rise of nearly 1.15 +/- 0.25 degrees C/100 mW. The extent of cell heating induced by infrared tweezers confinement can be described by a heat conduction model that accounts for the absorption of infrared (IR) laser radiation in the aqueous cell core and membrane regions, respectively. The observed results are relevant to the assessment of the noninvasive nature of infrared trapping beams in micromanipulation applications and cell physiological studies. {\textcopyright} 1995, The Biophysical Society.

@article{Catala2017,
abstract = {In optical tweezers, heating of the sample due to absorption of the laser light is a major concern as temperature plays an important role at microscopic scale. A popular rule of thumb is to consider that, at the typical wavelength of 1064 nm, the focused laser induces a heating rate of B = 1 °C/100 mW. We analysed this effect under different routine experimental conditions and found a remarkable variability in the temperature increase. Importantly, we determined that temperature can easily rise by as much as 4 °C at a relatively low power of 100 mW, for dielectric, non-absorbing particles with certain sets of specific, but common, parameters. Heating was determined from measurements of light momentum changes under drag forces at different powers, which proved to provide precise and robust results in watery buffers. We contrasted the experiments with computer simulations and obtained good agreement. These results suggest that this remarkable heating could be responsible for changes in the sample under study and could lead to serious damage of live specimens. It is therefore advisable to determine the temperature increase in each specific experiment and avoid the use of a universal rule that could inadvertently lead to critical changes in the sample.},

abstract = {A method is proposed for computing the low-Reynolds-number hydrodynamic forces on particles comprising a suspension confined by two parallel, no-slip walls. This is constructed via the two-dimensional analogue of Hasimoto's solution (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 5, 1959, pp. 317–328) for a periodic array of point forces in a viscous, incompressible fluid, and, like Hasimoto, the summation of interactions is accelerated by substitution and superposition of ‘Ewald-like' forcing. This method is akin to the accelerated Stokesian dynamics technique (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 448, 2001, pp. 115–146) and models the suspension dynamics with log–linear computational scaling. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated with a calculation of the high-frequency dynamic viscosity of a colloidal dispersion as function of volume fraction and channel width. Similarly, the short-time self-diffusivity for and the sedimentation rate of spherical particles in a confined suspension are determined. The results demonstrate the influence of confining geometry on the transport of small particles, which is becoming increasingly important for micro- and biofluidics.},

abstract = {Acoustofluidics, the fusion of acoustics and microfluidic techniques, has recently seen increased research attention across multiple disciplines due in part to its capabilities in contactless, biocompatible, and precise manipulation of micro-/nano-objects. Herein, a bimodal signal amplification platform which relies on acoustofluidics-induced enrichment of nanoparticles is introduced. The dual-function biosensor can perform sensitive immunofluorescent or surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) detection. The platform functions by using surface acoustic waves to concentrate nanoparticles at either the center or perimeter of a glass capillary; the concentration location is adjusted simply by varying the input frequency. The immunofluorescence assay is achieved by concentrating fluorescent analytes and functionalized nanoparticles at the center of the microchannel, thereby improving the visibility of the fluorescent output. By modifying the inner wall of the glass capillary with plasmonic Ag nanoparticle-deposited ZnO nanorod arrays and focusing analytes toward the perimeter of the microchannel, SERS sensing using the same device setup is achieved. Nanosized exosomes are used as a proof-of-concept to validate the performance of the acoustofluidic bimodal biosensor. With its sample-enrichment functionality, bimodal sensing, short processing time, and minute sample consumption, the acoustofluidic chip holds great potential for the development of lab-on-a-chip based analysis systems in many real-world applications.},

Since most investigations into this effect are experimental, there is a necessity in theoretical studies that could provide a deeper insight into the mechanism of the acoustic streaming and point out ways for optimizing acoustofluidic sharp-edge-based devices. In the present study, an analytical theory is developed that allows one to evaluate the velocity field of acoustic streaming generated at the apex of a wedge-shaped structure. Streamline patterns calculated by the developed theory show that the acoustic streaming is formed by two counterrotating vortices at the wedge apex. In addition to the analytical model, a numerical model is realized using the finite element method. Predictions of both models are described and compared with experimental observations.},

abstract = {A novel method of directly observing the effect of temperature rise in water at the vicinity of optical trap center is presented. Our approach relies on changed values of corner frequency of the optical trap that, in turn, is realized from its power spectra. Our two color experiment is a unique combination of a non-heating femtosecond trapping laser at 780 nm, coupled to a femtosecond infrared heating laser at 1560 nm, which precisely controls temperature at focal volume of the trap center using low powers (100-800 {\&}{\#}x00B5;W) at high repetition rate. The geometric ray optics model quantitatively supports our experimental data. },

abstract = {In this Part 13 of the tutorial series “Acoustofluidics–exploiting ultrasonic standing waves forces and acoustic streaming in microfluidic systems for cell and particle manipulation,” the streaming phenomenon is presented from an analytical standpoint, and perturbation methods are developed for analyzing such flows. Acoustic streaming is the phenomenon that takes place when a steady flow field is generated by the absorption of an oscillatory field. This can happen either by attenuation (quartz wind) or by interaction with a boundary. The latter type of streaming can also be generated by an oscillating solid in an otherwise still fluid medium or vibrating enclosure of a fluid body. While we address the first kind of streaming, our focus is largely on the second kind from a practical standpoint for application to microfluidic systems. In this Focus article, we limit the analysis to one- and two-dimensional problems in order to understand the analytical techniques with examples that most-easily illustrate the streaming phenomenon.},

@article{Bui2015,
abstract = {Whether or not an external force can make a trapped particle escape from optical tweezers can be used to measure optical forces. Combined with the linear dependence of optical forces on trapping power, a quantitative measurement of the force can be obtained. For this measurement, the particle is at the edge of the trap, away from the region near the equilbrium position where the trap can be described as a linear spring. This method provides the ability to measure higher forces for the same beam power, compared with using the linear region of the trap, with lower risk of optical damage to trapped specimens. Calibration is typically performed by using an increasing fluid flow to exert an increasing force on a trapped particle until it escapes. In this calibration technique, the particle is usually assumed to escape along a straight line in the direction of fluid-flow. Here, we show that the particle instead follows a curved trajectory, which depends on the rate of application of the force (i.e., the acceleration of the fluid flow). In the limit of very low acceleration, the particle follows the surface of zero axial optical force during the escape. The force required to produce escape depends on the trajectory, and hence the acceleration. This can result in variations in the escape force of a factor of two. This can have a major impact on calibration to determine the escape force efficiency. Even when calibration measurements are all performed in the low acceleration regime, variations in the escape force efficiency of 20{\&}{\#}x00025; or more can still occur. We present computational simulations using generalized Lorenz{\&}{\#}x02013;Mie theory and experimental measurements to show how the escape force efficiency depends on rate of increase of force and trapping power, and discuss the impact on calibration.},

For stiff traps, however, blur from image integration time affects the detected particle positions significantly. In this paper we use power spectral analysis to calibrate stiff optical traps, taking the effects of blur, aliasing and position detection error into account, as put forward by Wong and Halvorsen [Opt. Express 14, 12517 (2006)]. We find agreement with simultaneously obtained photodiode data and the expected relation of corner frequency fc with laser power, up to fc =3.6 kHz for a Nyquist frequency of 1.25 kHz. Spectral analysis enables easy identification of the contribution of noise. We demonstrate the utility of our approach with simultaneous calibration of multiple holographic optical traps. {\textcopyright} 2010 Optical Society of America.},

In the washing step, particles are washed with buffer solution with low conductivity for dielectrophoretic based separation to avoid the adverse effects of Joule heating. Acoustic waves generated by piezoelectric material are utilized for washing, which creates standing waves along the whole width of the channel. Coupled electro-mechanical acoustic 3D multi-physics analysis showed that the position and orientation of the piezoelectric actuators are critical for successful operation. A unique mold is designed for the precise alignment of the piezoelectric materials and 3D side-wall electrodes for a highly reproducible fabrication. To achieve the throughput matching of acoustophoresis and dielectrophoresis in the integration, 3D side-wall electrodes are used. The integrated device is fabricated by PDMS molding. The mold of the integrated device is fabricated using high-precision mechanical machining. With a unique mold design, the placements of the two piezoelectric materials and the 3D sidewall electrodes are accomplished during the molding process. It is shown that the proposed device can handle the wash and dielectrophoretic separation successfully.},

abstract = {We show experimental evidence of the acoustically-assisted micromanipulation of small objects like solid particles or blood cells, combining rotation and translation, using high frequency surface acoustic waves. This was obtained from the leakage in a microfluidic channel of two standing waves arranged perpendicularly in a LiNbO3 piezoelectric substrate working at 36.3 MHz. By controlling the phase lag between the emitters, we could, in addition to translation, generate a swirling motion of the emitting surface which, in turn, led to the rapid rotation of spherical polystyrene Janus beads suspended in the channel and of human red and white blood cells up to several rounds per second. We show that these revolution velocities are compatible with a torque caused by the acoustic streaming that develops at the particles surface, like that first described by [F. Busse et al., J. Acoust. Soc. Am., 1981, 69(6), 1634-1638]. This device, based on standard interdigitated transducers (IDTs) adjusted to emit at equal frequencies, opens a way to a large range of applications since it allows the simultaneous control of the translation and rotation of hard objects, as well as the investigation of the response of cells to shear stress.},

abstract = {Two orthogonal standing acoustic waves, generated by piezoelectric excitation, can form a two-dimensional pressure field in microfluidic devices. A phase difference of the excitation waves can be employed to rotate spherical $\mu$m-sized silica particles by a torque mediated through the viscous boundary $\delta$ around the particle. The measurement of the rotational rate is, so far, limited to high-speed cameras and their frame rate, and gets increasingly difficult when the sphere gets smaller. We report here a new method for measuring the rotational rate of $\mu$m sized spherical particles. We utilize an optical trap with high-speed position detection to overcome the frame rate limitation of wide field image recording. The power spectrum of an optically trapped, rotating particle reveals additional peaks corresponding to the rotational frequencies – compared to a non-rotating particle. We validate our method at low rotational rates against high-speed video observation. To demonstrate the potential of this method we addressed a recent controversy about the rotation of particles with a relatively large viscous boundary layer $\delta$. We measured steady-state rotational rates up to 229 Hz (13.8 × 103 rpm) for a particle with a radius R ≈ $\delta$. Recent numerical research suggests that in this regime the existing theoretical approach (valid for R ≫ $\delta$) overpredicts the steady-state rotational rate by a factor of 10. With our new method we also confirm the numerical results experimentally.},

The bewildering state of the literature and ample jargon from decades of research is reorganized and presented in the context of models derived from first principles. This hopefully will make the area accessible for researchers with experience in materials science, fluid mechanics, or dynamics. The abundance of interesting phenomena arising from nonlinear interactions in ultrasound that easily appear at these small scales is considered, especially in surface acoustic wave devices that are simple to fabricate with planar lithography techniques common in microfluidics, along with the many applications in microfluidics and nanofluidics that appear through the literature.},

abstract = {The interband optical properties of polystyrene in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) region have been investigated using combined spectroscopic ellipsometry and VUV spectroscopy. Over the range 1.5-32 eV, the optical properties exhibit electronic transitions we assign to three groupings, E1, E 2, and E3, corresponding to a hierarchy of interband transitions of aromatic ($\pi$→$\pi$*), non-bonding (n→$\pi$*, n →$\sigma$*), and saturated (n →$\sigma$*) orbitals. In polystyrene there are strong features in the interband transitions arising from the side-chain $\pi$ bonding of the aromatic ring consisting of a shoulder at 5.8 eV (E1') and a peak at 6.3 eV (E1), and from the $\sigma$ bonding of the C-C backbone at 12 eV (E3') and 17.1 eV (E3). These E3 transitions have characteristic critical point line shapes associated with one-dimensionally delocalized electron states in the polymer backbone. A small shoulder at 9.9 eV (E2) is associated with excitations possibly from residual monomer or impurities. Knowledge of the valence electronic excitations of a material provides the necessary optical properties to calculate the van der Waals-London dispersion interactions using Lifshitz quantum electrodynamics theory and full spectral optical properties. Hamaker constants and the van der Waals-London dispersion component of the surface free energy for polystyrene were determined. These Lifshitz results were compared to the total surface free energy of polystyrene, polarity, and dispersive component of the surface free energy as determined from contact angle measurements with two liquids, and with literature values. The Lifshitz approach, using full spectral Hamaker constants, is a more direct determination of the van der Waals-London dispersion component of the surface free energy of polystyrene than other methods. {\textcopyright} CSIRO 2007.},

The glass transition may be regarded as the melting point of amorphous substances and materials, a transition property of an outstanding technical importance. A crucial point is the fact that the presence of a glass transition is an unequivocal proof of an amorphous content of a material. Furthermore, the change of the specific heat at the glass transition temperature enables the quantitative determination of the amorphicity on a relative or absolute level of any substance or material. The absolute determination of the amorphicity affords a calibration with a reference corresponding to the material under investigation. The crystallinity for this reference substance must be known from the preparation and or by any independent analytical method. The literature data for the specific heat and the glass transition of polystyrene were collected and evaluated. Data were found for the specific heat in literature from 10 to 470 K. The data were unified for each of the reported temperature in a mean value and the corresponding standard deviation was determined. An excellent conformity was found in the glassy state of polystyrene with standard deviations lower than 0.7{\%}. The standard deviations above the glass transition were considerably higher. All these literature data were transferred for each of the literature sets separately into linear specific heat functions in the vicinity of the glass transition. One set of our measurements performed with the DSC 204 and with polystyrene SRM 705a as sample material was additionally integrated in the mean of these functions for the glassy state and the liquid amorphous state respectively. The addition of our results gave practically no change of the mean coefficients and only a decrease of the standard deviations. In such a way, the data with the best statistical base for the specific heat of polystyrene are listed in this paper ( 'Conclusions'). The glass transition as a transition in and out of a non-equilibrium state, the glassy state, is sensitive to all kind of influences such as thermal and mechanical treatments as well as to the selected experimental conditions. Therefore, certain standardized conditions procedures must be fulfilled to get reproducible data. The literature data for the glass transition temperature were also used to get a mean value. However, two values were omitted for the formation of the mean, because the authors reported values, which were too low on the base of impurities present. The mean value of the glass transition for polystyrene is according to the literature 369±2 K. A mean value of 370±2 K was extrapolated for an infinite molecular mass. The DSC and TMDSC measurements for the three thermodynamic properties reported in this paper, namely the specific heat, the glass transition temperature and the corresponding change of the specific heat gave results without significant differences compared with the literature values. Atactic polystyrene is a rather ideal polymer together with sapphire as calibration substance to elucidate and validate the DSC and TMDSC procedures for the determination of the specific heat and the glass transition. {\textcopyright} 2006 Akad{\'{e}}miai Kiad{\'{o}}, Budapest.},

We present gradient acoustic focusing that enables flow-through particle separation of submicron particles and cells and we apply it for separation of bacteria from blood lysate to facilitate their detection in whole blood for improved diagnostics. To control suspended objects below the classical 2µm size limit for acoustic focusing, we introduce a co-flowing acoustic impedance gradient to generate a stabilizing acoustic volume force that supresses acoustic streaming. The method is validated theoretically and experimentally using polystyrene particles, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. The applicability of the method is demonstrated by the separation of bacteria from selectively chemically lysed blood. Combined with downstream operations, this new approach opens up for novel methods for sepsis diagnostics.},

This serves as a simple model system for describing laser trapping and manipulation of living cells and organelles within cells. The gradient and scattering forces are defined for beams of complex shape in the ray-optics limit. Forces are calculated over the entire cross-section of the sphere using TEM(00) and TEM(01) (*) mode input intensity profiles and spheres of varying index of refraction. Strong uniform traps are possible with force variations less than a factor of 2 over the sphere cross-section. For a laser power of 10 mW and a relative index of refraction of 1.2 we compute trapping forces as high as approximately 1.2 x 10(-6) dynes in the weakest (backward) direction of the gradient trap. It is shown that good trapping requires high convergence beams from a high numerical aperture objective. A comparison is given of traps made using bright field or differential interference contrast optics and phase contrast optics.},

The general features of the optical            constants over the electromagnetic spectrum are relatively consistent throughout the            literature. In particular, silica glass is effectively opaque for wavelengths shorter            than 200 nm and larger than 3.5-4.0 $\mu$m. Strong absorption bands are observed (i) below            160 nm due to the interaction with electrons, absorption by impurities, and the presence            of OH groups and point defects; (ii) at {\~{}}2.73-2.85, 3.5, and 4.3 $\mu$m also caused by OH            groups; and (iii) at {\~{}}9-9.5, 12.5, and 21-23 $\mu$m due to SiOSi resonance modes of            vibration. However, the actual values of the refractive and absorption indices can vary            significantly due to the glass manufacturing process, crystallinity, wavelength, and            temperature and to the presence of impurities, point defects, inclusions, and bubbles,            as well as to the experimental uncertainties and approximations in the retrieval            methods. Moreover, new formulas providing comprehensive approximations of the optical            properties of silica glass are proposed between 7 and 50 $\mu$m. These formulas are            consistent with experimental data and substantially extend the spectral range of 0.21-7            $\mu$m covered by existing formulas and can be used in various engineering applications. },

abstract = {The majority of microfluidic devices nowadays are built on rigid or bulky substrates such as glass slides and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) slabs, and heavily rely on external equipment such as syringe pumps. Although a variety of micropumps have been developed in the past, few of them are suitable for flexible microfluidics or lab-on-a-foil systems. In this paper, stick-and-play acoustic micropump is built on thin and flexible plastic film by printing microstructures termed defended oscillating membrane equipped structures (DOMES) using two-photon polymerization. Specifically, this new micropump induces rectified flow upon the actuation of acoustic waves, and the flow patterns agree with simulation results very well. More importantly, the developed micropump has the capabilities to generate adjustable flow rates as high as 420 nL min−1, and does not suffer from problems such as bubble instability, gas dissolution, and undesired bubble-trapping that commonly occur in other forms of acoustic micropumps. Since the micropump works in stick-and-play mode, it is reusable after cleaning thanks to the easy separation of covers and substrates. Lastly, the developed micropump is applied for creating a self-pumped single-cell trapping device. The excellent trapping capability of the integrated device proves its potential for long-term studies of biological behaviors of individual cells for biomedical applications.},

abstract = {This work presents an acoustic trap with integrated thin film sensors to monitor temperature variations during operation. The acoustic trap is wet-etched in glass with a thermally bonded glass lid and the thin-film sensors are integrated during fabrication. We evaluated the performance of the integrated temperature sensors and measured a temperature sensitivity of ±0.01°C and confirmed that the read-out of the thin film sensors was not affected neither by the ionic conductivity of the solution nor the addition of microparticles into the acoustic trap. From the experiments we observed a temperature increase of the acoustic trap during operation as a result of the dissipative heating of the the piezoelectric element used to actuate the trap. We also showed that when external convective cooling was applied to the system, the temperature increase of the acoustic trap was higher than the temperature increase of the piezoelectric element itself.

abstract = {The use of ultrasonic standing waves for contactless manipulation of microparticles in microfluidic systems is a field with potential to become a new standard tool in lab-on-chip systems. Compared to other contactless manipulation methods ultrasonic standing wave manipulation shows promises of gentle cell handling, low cost, and precise temperature control. The technology can be used both for batch handling, such as sorting and aggregation, and handling of single particles. This doctoral Thesis presents multi-dimensional ultrasonic manipulation, i.e., manipulation in both two and three spatial dimensions as well as time-dependent manipulation of living cells and microbeads in microfluidic systems. The lab-on-chip structures used allow for high-quality optical microscopy, which is central to many bio-applications. It is demonstrated how the ultrasonic force fields can be spatially confined to predefined regions in the system, enabling sequential manipulation functions. Furthermore, it is shown how frequency-modulated signals can be used both for spatial stabilization of the force fields as well as for flow-free transport of particles in a microchannel. Design parameters of the chip-transducer systems employed are investigated experimentally as well as by numerical simulations. It is shown that three-dimensional resonances in the solid structure of the chip strongly influences the resonance shaping in the channel.},
