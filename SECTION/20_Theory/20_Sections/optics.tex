The interaction of light with any other object is described best with a set of 
equations called the \emph{Maxwell equations}. This set of equations fully 
capture and describe the electromagnetic wave nature of light. These equations 
relate point wise the electric wave vector $\vb{E}$, the magnetic induction 
$\vb{B}$, the electric current density $\vb{J}$, the electric displacement 
$\vb{D}$, and the magnetic vector $\vb{H}$ with each other for objects where 
the physical properties are continuous in the neighbourhood of the point of 
interest~\cite{Born1980Ch1}
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
    \curl{\vb{H}} - \frac{1}{c}\pdv{t}\vb{D} &=\frac{4\pi}{c}\vb{J} 
    \label{eq:TO-ampere} \\
    \curl{\vb{E}} - \frac{1}{c}\pdv{t}\vb{B} &=  0
    \label{eq:TO-faraday} \\
    \div{\vb{D}} &= 4\pi\rho_{\MR{E}}
    \label{eq:TO-gauss} \\
    \div{\vb{B}} &= 0
    \label{eq:TO-gauss-mag}
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}
with $c$ being the speed of light and $\rho_{\MR{E}}$ the total electric charge 
density. Although, 
\cref{eq:TO-ampere,eq:TO-faraday,eq:TO-gauss,eq:TO-gauss-mag} describe the 
behavior of light fully, it is often more convenient to think of light as a 
collection of single rays. In the limit of a vanishing small light wavelength 
$\lambda_{\text{light}}=\lal$ compared to the object size $R$, the 
approximation of light as single rays is valid~\cite{Born1980Ch3}. This branch 
of describing the propagation of light is often called \emph{Ray Optics}.

Our laser has a wavelength of $\lal=\SI{785}{\nm}$ and the smallest object we 
use has a radius of $R=\SI{1.03}{\um}$. The ratio $\sfrac{2R}{\lal}\approx 2.6$ 
is close to unity and the application of ray optics in our case might be 
questionable. However, previous works with our optical trap
\cite{Lakaemper2015,Lamprecht2016,Lamprecht2017} have shown that the ray 
approximation is a reasonable approach for our setup.
% In addition, one has to differentiate between quantitative and qualitative 
% analysis. For most results in our thesis we use our optical trapping setup as 
% tool for relating results qualitatively.

\section{Experimental Setup}

  (QPDs). In the top half red shading and the black lines outline the laser 
intensity profile qualitatively. In the bottom half just the most outer laser 
rays are depicted.}
  \label{fig:TO-setup}
\end{figure}

Before highlighting important parts from ray optics it is advantageous to 
understand our optical trapping setup which is based upon the work of Arthur 
Ashkin~\cite{Ashkin1978,Ashkin1987,Ashkin2002,Ashkin1986,Ashkin1992,Ashkin1997}. 
\cref{fig:TO-setup} depicts a basic schematic of the laser path from the laser 
source to the quadrant photo detectors (QPDs) in the back focal plane. A 
complete overview of our setup with a list and explanation of every used part 
is available in~\cite{Lamprecht2017}. In the following, we will highlight the 
path of the light from the laser source to the QPDs.

Our laser diode emits a tightly confined laser beam in the near-infrared regime 
(non-visible) with a wavelength of $\lal=\SI{785}{\nm}$ and a maximal power of 
$P=\SI{200}{\milli\watt}$ and with a transverse electromagnetic mode of order 
00 (TEM$_{00}$). This laser profile is axisymmetric to the light propagation 
direction and can be visualized with a rotating Gaussian bell curve. Next, the 
beam is expanded such that it is much larger than the opening of the microscope 
housing. The magnitude of the trapping forces are proportional to the laser 
intensity of the beam. The biggest contribution to the total trapping force 
stems from the outer parts of the beam because there greater incident angles 
are present. Therefore, the beam is broadened before guiding it to the focusing 
lens. The opening of the microscope is overfilled by the broadened beam such 
that the laser intensity is cutoff and can be approximated with a flat-top 
profile. Hence, every light ray (also the ones contributing most to the total 
trapping force) carry the same power.

The next step is the focusing of the beam with a high numerical aperture (NA) 
oil immersion lens. Here, the actual trapping of the particle occurs. If more 
than just the trapping of particles is of interest, the beam needs to be 
investigated further. The relative movement of the particle within the trap 
contains the necessary information. In order to image the movement in all three 
spatial directions the beam is collimated again by the condensor lens after it 
passed the particle and filtered to reduce its total intensity to prevent 
damage of the QPDs. Before the beam is focussed, it is split into two parts 
because the axial movement detection for $\ez$ and the in plane movement 
detection for $\ex$ and $\ey$ have inherently different working principles.

If the particle moves within the trap the spot on the QPDxy will also move. By 
measuring the voltage on each quadrant of the QPDxy and summing and subtracting 
certain quadrants it is possible to retrieve the information about the movement 
in each direction separately. For the axial direction the opening of the QPDz 
is overfilled. An axial movement of the particle causes a change of total 
intensity on this QPD. By measuring the QPDz total intensity we have the 
information about the relative movement of the particle within the 
trap~\cite{Felgner1995a}. After the calibration of the OT the measured 
voltages that are proportional to the particle movement can be converted to the 
physical unit meter. The calibration process itself is not relevant for this 
thesis but is available in~\cite{Lamprecht2017}. A discussion of different 
calibration options is available from 
\citeauthor{Svoboda1994}~\cite{Svoboda1994} and 
\citeauthor{Jun2004}~\cite{Jun2004}.

In the following, we will always assume water as fluid medium and Silicon 
Dioxide (SiO$_{2}$) as particle material. All calculations are also applicable 
to other fluid-particle material combinations with adapted material parameters.

\section{Ray Optics\label{sec:TO-rayoptics}}

As said before, in the regime of ray optics the propagation of light is 
visualized by single rays. The interaction of a single ray at an interface is 
then studied geometrically. The defining property for ray optics is the so 
called refractive index $\refraction$. Light travels in vacuum at speed of 
light $c=\SI{299792458}{\m\per\s}$. Outside of vacuum the speed of light has a 
smaller magnitude. The refractive index relates the speed of light of vacuum 
$c$ to any other material $c_{\Box}$
\begin{equation}
  c_{\Box} = \frac{c}{n}.
  \label{eq:TO-lightspeed}
\end{equation}
Since there is nothing faster than the speed of light, the refractive index 
$\refraction$ cannot be smaller than 1. This index is not constant for one 
material but a function of the wavelength $\lal$. Additionally, the 
refractive is in general a complex quantity
\begin{equation}
  \refraction\geq 1 \quad \wedge \quad \refraction \coloneqq 
  \refraction(\lal) = \refraction(\lal) - \iu \refraction_{\iu}(\lal)
  \label{eq:TO-refractive-index}
\end{equation}
where $\refraction_{\iu}$ is called the extinction 
coefficient~\cite{Jackson2013}. The absorption coefficient~\cite{Hecht2017}
\begin{equation}
  \alpha = \frac{4\pi f \refraction_{\iu}}{c} = 
  \frac{4\pi}{\lal}\refraction_{\iu}\quad\text{with}\quad\lal=\frac{c}{f}
  \label{eq:TO-alpha}
\end{equation}
converts the dimensionless quantity $\refraction_{\iu}$ into a physical 
parameter with unit \si{\per\meter} and is a measure for the absorbed energy; a 
higher value implies a more absorption per traveled distance. After a distance 
of $\alpha\left(\lal\right)^{-1}$ the ray intensity with wavelength $\lal$ 
decreased by 63.2\%. \Cref{fig:TO-n_water} depicts $n$ and $\alpha$ of water 
for different wavelengths $\lal$. Whereas the real part of the refractive index 
is about constant for $\lal > \SI{400}{\nm}$, the absorption coefficient 
changes its value over 4 orders of magnitude in the same interval.

\begin{figure}[tbp]
  \centering
  % \input{\relPath/10_Figures/TikZ/n_water.tikz}
  \includegraphics[]{External/n_water.eps}
  \caption{Index of refraction $n$ and absorption coefficient $\alpha$ for 
  water over wavelength $\lal$. Data taken from 
\cite{Hale1973,Segelstein1981}.}
  \label{fig:TO-n_water}
\end{figure}


Any ray of any wavelength is attenuated when propagating through a medium. The 
\emph{Beer-Lambert Law}
\begin{equation}
  \intensity(s) = \intensity_{0}\exp(-\alpha s)
  \label{eq:TO-beer-lambert}
\end{equation}
captures the change of intensity while moving along the path $s$ where 
$\intensity_{0}$ is the intensity at the start of the path. E.g. in a depth of 
approximately \SI{1}{\kilo\meter} it is completely dark in the ocean because 
all the intensity of the sunlight is attenuated there.

\begin{figure}[tbp]
  \centering
  % \input{\relPath/10_Figures/TikZ/Snell.tikz}
  \includegraphics[]{External/Snell.pdf}
  \caption{Visualization of Snell's Law for rays at an interface of two media 
  with different refractive indices $\refraction_{\Box}$.}
  \label{fig:TO-Snell}
\end{figure}

With the real part of the complex refractive index $\refraction(\lal)$, it is 
possible to define the most important relation in the ray optics regime: 
\emph{Snell's Law} (see also \cref{fig:TO-Snell}) is defined as
\begin{equation}
  \nf\,\sin\incident = \ns\,\sin\transmitted.
  \label{eq:TO-Snell}
\end{equation}
It connects the angle of incident $\incident$ with the transmitted angle 
$\transmitted$ at an interface of two different media with refractive indices 
$\nf$ and $\ns$, respectively. This law is based on the fact that a ray of 
light travels on the fastest path (not the shortest) between two 
points~\cite{Born1980Ch3}. The angle of the reflected ray is equal to the 
incident angle ($\reflected=\incident$).

Another angle of special interest is the angle of total internal reflection 
$\theta_{\MR{TIR}}$
\begin{equation}
  \theta_{\MR{TIR}}=\incident \quad\forall\quad \frac{\nf}{\ns}\,\sin\incident 
  > 1.
  \label{eq:TO-TIR}
\end{equation}
For incident angles of this magnitude or greater 
($\incident\geq\theta_{\MR{TIR}}$), no ray is transmitted into the other 
medium. This can only occur if the index of refraction of the incident medium 
is greater than the transmitted medium ($\nf>\ns$ in \cref{fig:TO-Snell}) 
otherwise the ratio $\sfrac{\nf}{\ns}$ of \cref{eq:TO-TIR} is always smaller 
than unity and there is physically no total internal reflection possible.

% The other angle of special interest is the so called \emph{Brewster Angle} 
% $\theta_{\MR{B}}$
% \begin{equation}
  % \theta_{\MR{B}} = \tan^{-1}\left( \frac{\ns}{\nf} \right).
  % \label{eq:TO-brewster}
% \end{equation}
% At this angle there does not occur an reflection and hence all the intensity is 
% transmitted.

So far, \cref{eq:TO-Snell} calculates in which direction a ray will travel 
after an interface of two media. The amplitude of the reflected and transmitted 
rays can be computed with the so called \emph{Fresnel 
Equations}~\cite{Jackson2013,Born1980Ch1}. Although we think of light as rays, 
the theory behind those equations is based on the electromagnetic wave 
character of light. For time harmonic electromagnetic waves the amplitude of 
the incident electric wave vector $\vb{E}_{\MR{i}}$ to the transmitted electric 
wave vector $\vb{E}_{\MR{t}}$ and to the reflected electric wave vector 
$\vb{E}_{\MR{r}}$ is related by $\fresnelr_{i}$ and $\fresnelt_{i}$
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
  \vb{E}_{\MR{r}} & =\fresnelr_{i}\,\vb{E}_{\MR{i}} \\[3mm]
  \vb{E}_{\MR{t}} & =\fresnelt_{i}\,\vb{E}_{\MR{i}}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where the subscript $i$ can either be $i=\MR{p}$ for p-polarized light or 
$i=\MR{s}$ for s-polarized light~\cite{Jackson2013,Born1980Ch1}. ``s'' and 
``p'' stand for the German words ``parallel'' (parallel) and ``senkrecht'' 
(perpendicular), respectively. They refer to the orientation of the incident 
electric field $\vb{E}_{\MR{i}}$ to the plane of incident. For the special 
cases of ``p'' and ``s'' polarized light the Fresnel coefficient with the 
assumption that both media are non-magnetic ($\mu_{\MR{f}} = \mu_{\MR{s}} = 
\mu_{0} = 1$)~\cite{Born1980Ch1} are
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
  \fresnelr_{\MR{s}} & =
  \frac{2\,\nf\,\cos\incident}{\nf\,\cos\incident + \ns\,\cos\reflected} 
  \label{eq:TO-fresnel-rs}\\[3mm]
  \fresnelt_{\MR{s}} & = \frac{\nf\,\cos\incident - 
  \ns\,\cos\reflected}{\nf\,\cos\incident + \ns\,\cos\reflected} 
  \label{eq:TO-fresnel-ts}\\[3mm]
  \fresnelr_{\MR{p}} & =
  \frac{2\,\nf\,\cos\incident}{\ns\,\cos\incident + \nf\,\cos\reflected} 
  \label{eq:TO-fresnel-rp}\\[3mm]
  \fresnelt_{\MR{p}} & = \frac{\ns\,\cos\incident - 
  \nf\,\cos\reflected}{\ns\,\cos\incident + \nf\,\cos\reflected}.
\label{eq:TO-fresnel-tp}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
So far, the Fresnel coefficients relate the amplitudes of the incident 
electrical field to the transmitted and reflected electrical field. In general, 
the sum of $\fresnelr_{i}$ and $\fresnelt_{i}$ does not add up to unity.

For \cref{sec:TO-temperature}, it is necessary to know how much of the incident 
power $P_{\MR{i}}$ is transmitted and how much is reflected. The power 
$P=\intensity A$ is a product of the intensity $\intensity$ and the area $A$ it 
is acting on. The intensity is defined as the time-average of the Ponyting 
vector $\vb{S}$
\begin{equation}
  \intensity = \timeaverage{\abs{\vb{S}}} = 
  \timeaverage{\abs{\vb{E}_{0}\times\vb{H}_{0}}} = 
  \frac{1}{2}\,\frac{\refraction}{Z_{0}}\,\abs{\vb{E}_{0}}^{2} = 
  \frac{1}{2}\,\refraction\,c\epsilon_{0}\,\abs{\vb{E}_{0}}^{2}
\end{equation}
where $Z_{0}$ is the electrical impedance of free space and $\epsilon_{0}$ is 
the vacuum permittivity. With 
\cref{eq:TO-fresnel-rs,eq:TO-fresnel-ts,eq:TO-fresnel-rp,eq:TO-fresnel-tp} the 
scaling of the electrical field at the interface is defined. With the relation 
for the distance $w$ of two parallel rays at the interface (see also 
\cref{fig:TO-Snell})
\begin{equation}
  w = \frac{w_{\MR{i}}}{\cos\incident} = \frac{w_{\MR{r}}}{\cos\reflected} = 
  \frac{w_{\MR{t}}}{\cos\transmitted}
  \label{eq:TO-area}
\end{equation}
and the scaling of the power
\begin{equation}
  P = \intensity A \propto \refraction\,\abs{\vb{E}_{0}}^{2}A \propto
  \refraction\,\abs{\vb{E}_{0}}^{2}w_{\Box}
\end{equation}
one can calculate the reflectance $\fresnelR_{i}$ as the ratio of the reflected 
power $P_{\MR{r}}$ to the incident power $P_{\MR{i}}$ as
\begin{equation}
  \fresnelR_{i} = \frac{P_{\MR{r}}}{P_{\MR{i}}} = 
  \frac{\intensity_{\MR{r}}\,\nf\,w_{\MR{r}}}{\intensity_{\MR{i}}\,\nf\,w_{\MR{i}}} 
  =\frac{\abs{\fresnelr_{i}\,\vb{E}_{0}}^{2}}{\abs{\vb{E}_{0}}^{2}} = 
  \fresnelr_{i}^{2}
  \label{eq:TO-fresnelR}
\end{equation}
where again the italic $i$ in the subscript ($\Box_{i}$) is the polarization. 
Similarly one finds the transmittance $\fresnelT_{i}$ as
\begin{equation}
  \fresnelT_{i} = \frac{P_{\MR{t}}}{P_{\MR{i}}} = 
  \frac{\intensity_{\MR{t}}\,\ns\,w_{\MR{t}}}{\intensity_{\MR{i}}\,\nf\,w_{\MR{i}}} 
  =\frac{\abs{\fresnelt_{i}\,\vb{E}_{0}}^{2}}{\abs{\vb{E}_{0}}^{2}}\,\frac{\ns\,w_{\MR{t}}}{\nf\,w_{\MR{i}}} 
  = \fresnelt_{i}^{2}\,\frac{\ns\,\cos\transmitted}{\nf\,\cos\incident}.
  \label{eq:TO-fresnelT}
\end{equation}
For unpolarized rays one can take the arithmetic average of $\Box_{\MR{s}}$ and 
$\Box_{\MR{p}}$ polarization values. Other than the Fresnel coefficients the 
sum of the reflectance $\fresnelR$ and the transmittance $\fresnelT$ for one 
angle of incidence need to be unity
\begin{equation}
  \fresnelR + \fresnelT = 
  \frac{\fresnelR_{\MR{s}}+\fresnelR_{\MR{p}}}{2} +
  \frac{\fresnelT_{\MR{s}}+\fresnelT_{\MR{p}}}{2} = 1 
  \label{eq:TO-fresnel}
\end{equation}
because the incident power $P_{\MR{i}}$ is either reflected or transmitted
\begin{equation}
  P_{\MR{i}} = P_{\MR{r}} + P_{\MR{t}} = P_{\MR{i}}\left( \fresnelR + \fresnelT 
  \right).
\end{equation}

\section{Laser Induced Temperature Change\label{sec:TO-temperature}}

A laser is a highly focused coherent beam of electromagnetic waves of a single 
wavelength $\lal$. Intensities with the orders of 
\si{\mega\watt\per\square\meter} and more are common. For comparison, the 
average intensity of the sun on to the earth in Central Europe is about 
\SI{1.36}{\kilo\watt\per\square\meter}, and the laser of our setup has with its 
peak power of \SI{200}{\milli\watt} and a specified beam diameter of 
\SI{1}{\mm} a maximal intensity of about 
\SI{0.25}{\mega\watt\per\square\meter}. As described with the Beer-Lambert-Law
(\cref{eq:TO-beer-lambert}) some of the laser intensity is attenuated while 
traveling through a medium. The attenuation of intensity will lead to an 
increase of temperature in the absorbing medium.

The intensity of a focused laser is highest in the region of the focal point 
because all its power is confined to a small area width width of about one wave 
length. Direct temperature measurements in the vicinity of the laser focus are 
due to the microscopic region of interest up to now not possible. Precise 
knowledge of the temperature change is of interest, e.g., for the calibration 
process of the OT but also for objects that need to stay below a certain 
temperature, e.g.  living cells.

In the following, we will first discuss the current research regarding 
temperature increase in OTs, discuss the path of a ray through the particle, 
and then motivate a temperature approximation based on simple ray optics.

\subsection{State of the Art}\label{sec:TO-state}

\cyear{Liu1995} measured the temperature dependent change in fluorescence of 
biological cells while being trapped with a wavelength of 
$\lal=\SI{1064}{\nm}$. They found a linear relation between temperature 
increase and applied laser power of about \SI{15}{\degreeCelsius\per\watt}. In 
addition, they solved the heat problem also analytically. For that, they 
neglected the trapped object and modeled it as water because their cells of 
interest consist mainly out of water. The experiments as well as the analytical 
solution show an almost instantaneous change in temperature after the laser is 
switched on.

\cyear{Celliers2000} measured the local change in the index of refraction for 
water while being subjected to a laser with a wavelength of \SI{985}{\nm}. 
During the measurements no objects were trapped in the laser focus. They 
measured a temperature increase of \SI{4}{\degreeCelsius} with a laser power of 
\SI{55}{\milli\watt} in the focus of the laser. An analytical model that 
utilized an improved source term compared to \cite{Liu1995} validated their 
results.

\cyear{Peterman2003} measured with a OT of \SI{1064}{\nm} wavelength the 
effects of the temperature increase in the vicinity of the laser focus. A 
change of temperature in the fluid will lead to a change of the fluid 
viscosity. The viscosity change alters the calibration parameters of the OT. By 
fitting the calibration parameters for different laser powers to the 
theoretical relation they found a temperature increase of roughly 
\SI{8}{\degreeCelsius\per\watt} for water as fluid medium and silica beads as 
trapped object. More interestingly, their analytical model revealed that most 
of the heat absorption is in the fluid rather than the trapped object. In 
addition, usual glass coverslips act as fast heat conductor compared to water 
such that measurements close to the top or bottom surface of the fluid cavity 
lead to a minor temperature increase.

\cyear{Moreau2015} injected Rhodamine B (RhB) in cells to measure the 
temperature change of an OT with \SI{800}{\nm} wavelength. RhB is a temperature 
sensitive dye which changes its fluorescence linearly with the temperature. 
Since they injected the RhB into the cell the measured temperature difference 
was close to the focal point. As before, the increase of the temperature occurs 
almost instantaneously and is about \SI{9}{\degreeCelsius\per\watt}.

Lastly, in \citeyear{Catala2017}, \cname{Catala2017} studied the effects of 
different experimental parameters (NA, material of trapped object, distance to 
coverslips, object radius) to the magnitude of the temperature increase with an 
OT of \SI{1064}{\nm} wavelength. A numerical model validated their experimental 
findings. Their source term which is an extension to \cname{Peterman2003} takes 
account of the NA, the finite focal spot size, and the wavelength of the laser 
itself. In agreement to the others they found the heat increase to be about 
\SI{20}{\degreeCelsius\per\watt}.

All of the aforementioned studies (see also \cref{tab:TO-heating}) validated in 
their experiments the linear relation of the applied laser power to the 
increase in temperature. Also, they showed that the temperature change occurs 
almost instantaneously and that a steady system without any further temperature 
increase is established in the range of a few \si{\ms}. In addition, they agree 
that the main absorption occurs in the fluid medium (water or glycerol) rather 
than the trapped object (polystyrene or silica) itself because the absorption 
coefficient of the fluid $\alpha_{\MR{f}}$ is greater than of the particle 
$\alpha_{\MR{s}}$. Besides \cite{Moreau2015} all studies operate at a 
wavelength of \SI{1064}{\nm}. Our OT operates at \SI{785}{\nm} and the 
absorption coefficient $\alpha_{\MR{f}}$ for this wavelength and for water is 
about one order of magnitude smaller than it is at \SI{1064}{\nm},
$\alpha_{\MR{f}}(\SI{785}{\nm}) \approx \SI{2.14}{\per\meter} $ and 
$\alpha_{\MR{f}}(\SI{1064}{\nm}) \approx \SI{15.4}{\per\meter} $ respectively. 
The magnitude of the absorption coefficient $\alpha_{\MR{f}}$ is the measure 
for how much power gets absorbed by the fluid. The parameter $\alpha_{\MR{f}}$ 
contributes linear to the source term in the heat equation.

Besides the results of \cname{Peterman2003} the measured temperature increase 
is larger for the wavelength of \SI{1064}{\nm}. The magnitudes of the 
respective absorption coefficients $\alpha$ ($\sfrac{15.4}{2.14}\approx 7.2$) 
suggest a seven times greater heating for the larger wavelength. However, only 
the results of \cname{Celliers2000} compared to \cname{Moreau2015} match this 
interpolation. But \cname{Celliers2000} used an inherently different method for 
approximating the temperature increase where no object was trapped during the 
measurement.  Despite having non-coherent results, we take a heating value of 
\SI{10}{\degreeCelsius\per\watt} for water and our wavelength of \SI{785}{\nm} 
as given for the following section if the focus of the OT is at least 
\SI{10}{\um} away from any surrounding surface.

\subsection[Ray Path \& absorbed Energy]{Ray Path through Particle and absorbed 
Energy}

Before approximating the heat distribution inside the trapped particle with ray 
optics, it is necessary to investigate the path of the ray though the particle. 
In \cref{fig:TO-ray_particle} a ray with power $\power{i}{1}$ is incident on 
the particle surface in point $I$. The direction of the ray is towards the 
focal point $f$ which is slightly above the middle point $M$ of the particle 
because the stable trapping position is the equilibrium of the trapping forces 
towards the point $f$ and gravity. Because of the different refractive indices 
of the fluid $\nf$ and the particle $\ns$ the ray gets deflected inside the 
particle. The transmitted angle $\transmitted$ can easily be computed with 
\cref{eq:TO-Snell}. However, for that the incident angle $\incident$ must be 
known.

\begin{figure}[thp]
  \centering
  % \input{\relPath/10_Figures/TikZ/ray.tikz}
  \includegraphics[]{External/ray.pdf}
  \caption{Schematic of ray path through particle.}
  \label{fig:TO-ray_particle}
\end{figure}

With the convergence angle $\beta$ (see \cref{fig:TO-angles}) and the sine-law
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\sin\left( \frac{\pi}{2}-\beta \right)}{\R} = 
  \frac{\sin\incident}{a\,\R}
  \label{eq:TO-sine-law}
\end{equation}
one can compute $\incident$ as function of $\beta$. The angle $\beta$ is an 
input parameter and therefore known. The maximal convergence angle 
$\beta_{\MR{max}}$ is evaluated by the definition of the NA
\begin{equation}
  \cNA = \nf\,\sin\beta_{\MR{max}}.
  \label{eq:TO-NA}
\end{equation}
Our lens has a $\cNA$ of 1.27 and water has a refractive index of $\nf=1.33$ 
(see \cref{fig:TO-n_water}) and therefore our maximal convergence angle 
$\beta_{\MR{max}} \approx \SI{72}{\degree}$.

With the knowledge of $\transmitted^{1}$ the path of the ray inside the 
particle is determined. At the next intersection point of the ray with the 
particle surface $N$, the ray is again partly transmitted into the fluid and 
partly reflected. Since the triangle $\bigtriangleup_{IMN}$ is an isosceles 
triangle (two sides have the same length $R$) and since per definition the 
reflected angle equals the incident angle, all internal reflection angles for 
one ray have the same magnitude 
($\transmitted^{1}=\incident^{n}=\reflected^{n}$ for $n>1$).

Now, the respective powers of one ray can be evaluated. The ray has the 
incident power $\power{i}{1}$ with every reflection it gets split into two 
portions. With \cref{eq:TO-fresnelR,eq:TO-fresnelT,eq:TO-fresnel} the powers 
after each reflection is
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{alignat}{3}
    \power{t}{1} & = \fresnelT\left( \incident^{1} \right)\,\power{i}{1} && \\
    \power{r}{2} & = \fresnelR\left( \transmitted^{1} \right)\,\power{t}{1} && 
    = \power{i}{1}\,\fresnelT\left( \incident^{1} \right)\,
    \fresnelR\left( \transmitted^{1} \right) \\
    \power{t}{2} & = \fresnelT\left( \transmitted^{1} \right)\,\power{t}{1} && 
    = \power{i}{1}\,\fresnelT\left( \incident^{1} \right)\,
    \fresnelT\left( \transmitted^{1} \right) \\
    \power{r}{3} & = \fresnelR\left( \transmitted^{1} \right)\,\power{i}{3} && 
    = \power{i}{1}\,\fresnelT\left( \incident^{1} \right)\,
    \fresnelR^{2}\left( \transmitted^{1} \right).
\end{alignat}
\end{subequations}

\end{figure}

If a particle is stably trapped the distance $aR$ of the particle center point 
$M$ and the focal point $f$ (see also \cref{fig:TO-angles}) is about $aR 
\approx 0.1R$~\cite{Lamprecht2017}. During the trapping process and due to 
external forces this distances changes. If the focal point is outside the 
particle, the trapping forces are negligible small.

\cref{fig:TO-gamma_theta} depicts the values of $\gamma$ and $\incident$, 
respectively, for different combinations of $a$ and $\beta$. As pointed out 
before, the value $a \approx 0.1$. For this value the maximal incident angle 
$\incident$ over the whole range of $\beta$ is less than \SI{10}{\degree}.

    shaded area marks the interval of incident angles $\incident$ that do not 
  occur in our setup.}
  \label{fig:TO-fresnel}
\end{figure}

Finally, we can estimate the total relative absorbed energy $\Xi$ by the 
particle. \cref{eq:TO-beer-lambert} defines the intensity of a single ray after 
the distance $s$. Hence the relative absorbed intensity over this length is
\begin{equation}
  \intensity_{\MR{abs}} = \intensity_{0} \left( 1 - \exp(-\alpha_{\MR{s}}\,s) 
  \right).
    \label{eq:TO-absorbed_energy}
\end{equation}
The distance $s$ for one passage through the particle can be computed as 
function of $\beta$ as
\begin{equation}
  s\left( \beta \right)
  =
  2R\,\cos\transmitted
  =
  2R\,\cos\left\{ \transmitted\left[ \incident\left( \beta \right) \right] 
  \right\}.
    \label{eq:TO-distance_s}
\end{equation}
And the power of a ray after $j$ reflections inside the particle is
\begin{equation}
  \begin{alignedat}{3}
    \power{i}{j} &=
    \power{i}{1} \, &&
    \fresnelT_{\MR{f}\rightarrow\MR{s}}\left( \incident \right) \, &&
    \left[\fresnelR_{\MR{s}\rightarrow\MR{f}}\left( \transmitted 
    \right)\right]^{(j)}\\
    &=
    \power{i}{1} \, &&
    \fresnelT_{\MR{f}\rightarrow\MR{s}}
    \left( \incident\left( \beta \right) \right) \, &&
    \left[
      \fresnelR_{\MR{s}\rightarrow\MR{f}}
      \left( \transmitted\left( \incident\left( \beta \right) \right) \right)
  \right]^{(j)} \coloneqq \power{i}{j}\left( \beta \right)
  \end{alignedat}
  \label{eq:TO-power}
\end{equation}
where $\Box_{\MR{f}\rightarrow\MR{s}}$ indicates fluid-solid interface and 
$\Box_{\MR{s}\rightarrow\MR{f}}$ the solid-fluid interface. With 
\cref{eq:TO-absorbed_energy,eq:TO-distance_s,eq:TO-power} the relative absorbed 
energy $\Xi$ inside the particle can be approximated with $N$ discrete values
\begin{equation}
  \beta_{n} = \frac{n}{N}\,\beta_{\MR{max}}\quad\text{with}\quad 
  n\in\left\{1,2,\ldots,N\right\}.
  \label{eq:TO-beta-disc}
\end{equation}
to be
\begin{equation}
    % \intensity_{\MR{tot.,abs.}} \approx
    \Xi \approx
    \frac{2\pi}{N}
    \sum\limits_{n=1}^{N}
    \sum\limits_{m=0}^{\infty}
    \left\{ 1 - \exp\left[-\alpha_{\MR{s}}\,s\left( \beta_{n} \right) \right] 
    \right\}
    \underbrace{\power{i}{m}\left( \beta_{n} \right)}_{
    \fresnelT_{\MR{f}\rightarrow\MR{s}}\left( \beta_{n}\right) \,
    \left[\fresnelR_{\MR{s}\rightarrow\MR{f}}\left(\beta_{n}\right)\right]^{(m)}
}
  \label{eq:TO-total-absorbed}
\end{equation}
where the factor $\sfrac{1}{N}$ is due to the assumption that each ray has the 
same incident power when hitting the particle surface and the factor $2\pi$ for 
considering the full volume of the particle. Per definition is the reflectance 
$\fresnelR$ or the transmittance $\fresnelT$ smaller than 1. This property as 
well as
\begin{equation}
  \sum\limits^{\infty}_{m=0} \Box^{m} = \frac{1}{1-\Box}
  \quad\text{for}\quad\abs{\Box} < 1
\end{equation}
can be applied to \cref{eq:TO-total-absorbed} to simplify the double sum to
\begin{equation}
  % \intensity_{\MR{tot.,abs.}} \approx
  \Xi \approx
  \frac{2\pi}{N}
  \sum\limits_{n=1}^{N}
  \fresnelT_{\MR{f}\rightarrow\MR{s}}\left( \beta_{n} \right)
  \left[ 1 - \exp\left( -\alpha_{\MR{s}}\,s\left( \beta_{n} \right) \right) 
  \right]
  \,\frac{1}{1-\fresnelR_{\MR{s}\rightarrow\MR{f}}\left( \beta_{n} \right)}.
  \label{eq:TO-total-absorbed-simp}k
\end{equation}

\cref{fig:TO-fresnel} depicts the values for $\fresnelT$ and $\fresnelR$ for 
the fluid-particle interface and the particle-fluid interface. Noteworthy is 
the fact, that for the occurring incident angles $\incident \leq 
\SI{10}{\degree}$ the values of $\fresnelR$ for both interface are less than 
$3\cdot 10^{-3}$. Therefore, most of the energy is transmitted and almost none 
reflected. For example, the relative power after one internal reflection and 
for an incident angle of $\incident=\SI{10}{\degree}$ is $\approx 2.07\cdot 
10^{-3}\,\power{i}{1}$ and after two internal reflections already $\approx 
4.31\cdot 10^{-6}\,\power{i}{1}$.

  distances $a$ and radii $R$ with $N=500$ }
  \label{fig:TO-absorbed_energies}
\end{figure}

\cref{fig:TO-absorbed_energies} shows the relative absorbed energy $\Xi$ inside 
a particle for various radii $R$ and distances $aR$. As \cref{fig:TO-fresnel} 
already suggested only a little fraction of the trapping energy is absorbed by 
the particle itself.

\subsection{Ray Optics Heat Approximation}

With the knowledge of the relative absorbed energy $\Xi$ of the particle, we 
solve the heat equation for the particle
\begin{equation}
  \laplacian{T} = \frac{1}{\kappa} \pdv{T}{t} - \frac{q}{K}
  \label{eq:TO-heat-prob}
\end{equation}
where $T$ is the temperature inside the particle, $q$ is the absorbed energy 
per unit volume, $K$ the thermal conductivity, and $\kappa$ the thermal 
diffusivity. Further, we neglect the time-dependence $\pdv{T}{t}= 0$ because 
all publications presented in \cref{sec:TO-state} state that the heating occurs 
within \si{\ms} and the temperature does not change afterwards anymore 
\begin{equation}
  \laplacian{T} = - \frac{q}{K}.
  \label{eq:TO-heat-stat}
\end{equation}
 In addition, we assume a spherical particle and solve the problem with a 
 spherical coordinate system (see \cref{fig:TA-coordinate}) with its origin at 
 the particle center. Furthermore, we take the source term $q$ to be constant 
 throughout the particle. Therefore, we neglect all partial derivatives to the 
 angles $\varphi$ and $\theta$ and solve an ordinary differential equation of 
 second order
\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{r^{2}}\pdv{r}\left( r^{2}\pdv{T}{r} \right) = - \frac{q}{K}
  \label{eq:TO-heat-spherical}
\end{equation}
with only a $r$ dependence and a constant source term. We complete the problem, 
with two boundary conditions
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
  \eval{\pdv{T}{r}}_{r=0} &= 0\\[3mm]
  \eval{T}_{r=R_{0}} &= T_{0}.
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
The first one implies a bounded temperature at the origin ($r=0$) and the 
second one fixes the temperature at the surface of the particle ($r=R_{0}$). 
After two consecutive integration and applying of the boundary conditions one 
finds the difference temperature to be
\begin{equation}
  \Delta T(r) = T(r) - T_{0} = \frac{q}{6K}\left( R_0^2 - r^{2} \right).
  \label{eq:TO-heat-sol}
\end{equation}
The average temperature over the whole particle is the volume integral of 
\cref{eq:TO-heat-sol}
\begin{equation}
  \overline{\Delta T} = \frac{1}{V}\int_{V}\Delta T(r) \dd{V} = 
  \frac{1}{15}\,\frac{q}{K}\,R^{2}_{0}.
  \label{eq:TO-heat-avg}
\end{equation}
This can be further simplified since $q$ is the absorbed energy per unit volume
\begin{equation}
  q = \frac{\Xi\,P}{V} = \frac{3}{4}\,\frac{\Xi\,P}{\pi\,R_{0}^{3}}
\end{equation}
where $P$ is the incident power of the laser and $V$ the volume of the 
particle. Finally, the average temperature increase of the spherical particle 
is
\begin{equation}
  \overline{\Delta T} = \frac{1}{20\,\pi}\,\frac{\Xi\,P}{R_{0}\,K}.
  \label{eq:TO-heat-sol-simp}
\end{equation}
Interestingly, \cref{eq:TO-heat-sol-simp} seems to scale with $\propto 
\sfrac{1}{R_{0}}$. However, the relative total absorbed energy $\Xi$ is also 
dependent on $R_{0}$ because the distance $s$ increases with the particle size 
linearly. But $\Xi$ scales with $\left[  1-\exp\left( -\alpha_{\MR{f}}\,R_{0} 
\right)\right]$ and therefore the average difference temperature 
$\overline{\Delta T}$ is proportional to $\sfrac{\left[ 1-\exp\left( 
-\alpha_{\MR{f}}\,R_{0} \right) \right]}{R_{0}}$. This seems counter-intuitive, 
that bigger particle sizes lead to less temperature increase. But this only 
holds for the average temperature difference $\overline{\Delta T}$, the maximal 
temperature distribution $T(r)\vert_{r=0}$ (\cref{eq:TO-heat-sol}) increases 
with the particle size.

  \caption{$\overline{\Delta T}$ of \cref{eq:TO-heat-sol-simp} for various 
  laser powers $P$ and particle radii $R$; 
$K=\SI{1.4}{\watt\per\meter\per\kelvin}$ for SiO$_{2}$.}
  \label{fig:TO-dT}
\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:TO-dT} depicts the average difference temperature for various 
combinations of laser power $P$ and particle radius $R$. With the information 
given in the aforementioned experimental studies regarding the heating by the 
laser and these ray optics motivated results for the heat distribution inside 
the particle, we conclude that the increase in temperature around and inside 
the particle for our setup is less than \SI{2}{\degreeCelsius} with the applied 
laser power in the low \si{\milli\watt} range. The main part is by the 
absorption of the fluid around the particle \begin{equation}
  \Delta T_{\MR{fluid}}
  \leq
  \SI{0.2}{\watt}\cdot\SI{10}{\celsius\per\watt}
  =
  \SI{2}{\celsius}
\end{equation}
with \SI{200}{\milli\watt} maximal available laser power for our setup and the 
SiO$_{2}$ particles gets only further heated by values smaller than 
\SI{70}{\milli\celsius}.

Having established an upper bound for the laser induced temperature increase, 
we can estimate the effects of the temperature increase to the absolute value 
of a measured force with the OT. The parameter that changes the most by a 
change in the temperature is the dynamic viscosity $\muef$ of the fluid. The 
viscosity is in general a function of the temperature $\muef\coloneqq\muef(T)$.  
For our calibration routine the absolute measured force of the OT scales with 
square root of the fluid viscosity ($\abs{\vb{\force}}\propto\sqrt{\muef}$).  
For the range of \SIrange{20}{30}{\degreeCelsius} the dynamic viscosity of 
water (exact formula from \cite{Peterman2003}) can be linearly approximated 
with
\begin{equation}
  \muef(T) = 8.9086\cdot 10^{-4} -2.0277\cdot10^{-5} (T-25).
  \label{eq:TO-viscosity}
\end{equation}
Temperature deviations of $\SI{25}{\degreeCelsius}\pm\SI{2}{\degreeCelsius}$ 
lead to force magnitude errors of less than $\pm$2.5\%. This percentage is 
acceptable little such that we neglect the temperature induced viscosity change 
and use the ambient room temperature as reference.

\section{Optical Position Detection\label{sec:TO-QPD}}

Besides trapping objects, the OT can also measure the relative movement of the 
trapped object within the trap. After a calibration of the OT, it is also 
possible to convert the movement into the physical unit of meters and then also 
convert it into a force with unit Newton. Besides doing the movement tracking 
visually with, e.g., a high-speed camera, the most common approach is do 
utilize QPDs.  The latter is superior to the camera because higher sampling 
rates are straightforward achievable, less data is produced during the 
measurement, as well as, a full three dimensional resolution is at hand.

In order to do so, the laser beam must be collimated after the object trapping 
region and then focussed with separate lenses onto two QPDs (see 
\cref{fig:TO-setup}). While the laser beam is focussed within the aperture of 
the QPD for the in-plane $xy$-direction (QPDxy), the beam is focussed to 
overfill the QPD aperture for the $z$-direction. For all measurements, where 
the measured signal of the QPDs need to be converted to meters, it is crucial 
to operate in the so-called \emph{linear regime} of the QPD. In the following, 
we will study what this terms stand for.

A QPD consists of a diode divided into four separate regions. Each of the four 
diodes measures the intensity of light on its respective area and returns a 
measure in voltage. \cref{fig:TO-QPD} is a schematic of the QPDxy where the 
focussed laser spot midpoint $M$ is at $x=x_{0}$ and $y=y_{0}$ and the radius 
of the laser spot is about $\sfrac{1}{5}\,R_{\MR{QPD}}$~\cite{Lamprecht2017}.

The normalized intensity distribution can be modeled as
\begin{equation}
  \tilde{\intensity} = \tilde{\intensity}(x, y) = 
  \frac{1}{2\pi\,R_{\MR{spot}}^{2}}\,\exp\left[ 
  -\frac{1}{2}\,\frac{(x-x_{0})^{2} + (y - y_{0})^{2}}{R_{\MR{spot}}^{2}} 
\right]
    \label{eq:TO-intensity}
\end{equation}
where the radius of the spot is $R_{\MR{spot}}=\sfrac{\RA}{5}$ and the property 
\begin{equation}
  \int\limits_{\dd{A}}\tilde{\intensity}\dd{A} = 1.
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[tbp]

  \caption{Sketch of quadrant photo detectors for $x$-$y$ detection with center 
  of laser image $M$ at $(x_{0}, y_{0})$.}
  \label{fig:TO-QPD}
\end{figure}

The received intensity $V_{i}$ per quadrant can be evaluated with four 
integrals over the respective areas
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
  V_{\MR{1}} & = \int_{0}^{\sfrac{\pi}{2}}\int_{0}^{\RA}
  \tilde{\intensity}\left( r\cos\varphi, r\sin\varphi 
  \right)\,r\,\dd{r}\dd{\varphi}
  \label{eq:TO-V1}
  \\[3mm]
  V_{\MR{2}} & = \int_{\sfrac{\pi}{2}}^{\pi}\int_{0}^{\RA}
  \tilde{\intensity}\left(r\cos\varphi, 
  r\sin\varphi\right)\,r\,\dd{r}\dd{\varphi}
  \label{eq:TO-V2}
  \\[3mm]
  V_{\MR{3}} & = \int_{\pi}^{\sfrac{3\pi}{2}}\int_{0}^{\RA}
  \tilde{\intensity}\left(r\cos\varphi, 
  r\sin\varphi\right)\,r\,\dd{r}\dd{\varphi}
  \label{eq:TO-V3}
  \\[3mm]
  V_{\MR{4}} & = \int_{\sfrac{3\pi}{2}}^{2\pi}\int_{0}^{\RA}
  \tilde{\intensity}\left(r\cos\varphi, 
  r\sin\varphi\right)\,r\,\dd{r}\dd{\varphi}
  \label{eq:TO-V4}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where we used polar integration and polar coordinates $x=r\cos\varphi$ and 
$y=r\sin\varphi$.

\begin{figure}[tbp]

  % \input{\relPath/10_Figures/TikZ/V_quadrant.tikz}

  \caption{Intensity per quadrant for various positions of laser image middle 
    point $M$ (see \cref{eq:TO-V1,eq:TO-V2,eq:TO-V3,eq:TO-V4}). The top right 
  plot is $V_{1}$, top left $V_{2}$, bottom left $V_{3}$, bottom right 
$V_{4}$.}
  \label{fig:TO-quadrant_Intensity}
\end{figure}

If the particle moves within the trap, the center of the laser image $M$ on the 
QPDxy also moves. \cref{fig:TO-quadrant_Intensity} shows the intensity per 
quadrant for different center positions. As expected, each quadrant is 
measuring the highest intensity whenever most of the laser image is over the 
respective area.

With these four separate values for $V_{1}$ through $V_{4}$, one can create a 
measure that is proportional to the movement of the laser image center $M$ 
along the $\ex$- and $\ey$-direction, respectively. The measure is an addition 
and subtraction of the quadrants along one direction
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
  V_{\MR{x}} & = \left( V_{\MR{1}}+V_{\MR{4}} \right) - \left( V_{\MR{2}} + 
  V_{\MR{3}}  \right)

  V_{\MR{t}} & = V_{\MR{1}}+V_{\MR{2}} + V_{\MR{3}} + V_{\MR{4}}.

    various positions of laser image middle point $M$. The dotted horizontal 
    lines are at $y=\sfrac{-0.6}{R_{\MR{QPD}}}$, $y=\sfrac{0}{R_{\MR{QPD}}}$, 
  and $y=\sfrac{0.6}{R_{\MR{QPD}}}$ respectively.}
  \label{fig:TO-QPDs}
 \end{figure}

As for the measured intensity per quadrant, the measured values are highest if 
the laser image is over the respective quadrants (see \cref{fig:TO-QPDs}). 
However, since $V_{\MR{x}}$ and $V_{\MR{y}}$ are composed by addition and 
subtraction of the strictly positive values $V_{i}$ the magnitude can now also 
be negative.

In \cref{fig:TO-voltages_over_x} the three measures are plotted over $x_{0}$ 
for three fixed values of $y_{0}$. This plot looks the same if $x_{0}$ is fixed 
and $y_{0}$ is the changing variable. Additionally the curves $V_{\MR{x}}$ and 
$V_{\MR{y}}$ change their behavior. There is a linear region for which a small 
movement of the laser image middle point $M$ is converted into a proportional 
change in the measured intensity on the QPD. However, this linear regime from 
$-0.15\,R_{\MR{QPD}}$ to $0.15\,R_{\MR{QPD}}$ is rather small. Therefore, it is 
very important to check and adjust the offset of the QPD before each 
measurement to ensure interpretability of the results.

Noteworthy is also that for values of $\sfrac{\abs{x_{0}}}{R_{\MR{QPD}}} > 0.5$ 
a further outwards movement does not lead to an increase of the respective 
measure but to a decrease. If just one measure, here $V_{\MR{y}}$, is taken 
into account then this decrease ($\sfrac{x_{0}}{R_{\MR{QPD}} > 0.5}$) is not 
distinguishable from the increase coming from the middle 
($\sfrac{x_{0}}{R_{\MR{QPD}} < 0.5}$). However, by also looking at the 
evolution of $V_{\MR{t}}$ it is possible to identify in which direction the 
laser image is moving on the QPD because this measure does not change its 
magnitude between $\sfrac{\abs{x_{0}}}{R_{\MR{QPD}}} < 0.5$.
