The interaction of light with any other object is described with a set of 
equations called the \emph{Maxwell equations}. This set of equations fully 
capture and describe the electromagnetic wave nature of light. These equations 
relate point wise the electric wave vector $\vb{E}$, the magnetic induction 
$\vb{B}$, the electric current density $\vb{J}$, the electric displacement 
$\vb{D}$, and the magnetic vector $\vb{H}$ with each other for objects where 
the physical properties are continuous in the neighbourhood of the point of 
interest~\cite{Born1980Ch1}
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
    \curl{\vb{H}} - \frac{1}{\tilde{\speed}}\pdv{t}\vb{D} 
    &=\frac{4\pi}{c}\vb{J} \label{eq:TO-ampere} \\
    \curl{\vb{E}} - \frac{1}{\tilde{\speed}}\pdv{t}\vb{B} &=  0
    \label{eq:TO-faraday} \\
    \div{\vb{D}} &= 4\pi\rho_{\MR{E}}
    \label{eq:TO-gauss} \\
    \div{\vb{B}} &= 0
    \label{eq:TO-gauss-mag}
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}
with $\tilde{\speed}$ being the speed of light and $\rho_{\MR{E}}$ the total 
electric charge density. Although, 
\cref{eq:TO-ampere,eq:TO-faraday,eq:TO-gauss,eq:TO-gauss-mag} describe the 
behavior of light to great extent, it is often more convenient to think of 
light as a collection of single rays. In the limit of a vanishing small light 
wavelength $\lal$ compared to the object size $R$, the approximation of light 
as single rays is valid~\cite{Born1980Ch3}. This branch of describing the 
propagation of light is often called \emph{Ray Optics}.

Our laser has a wavelength of $\lal=\SI{785}{\nm}$ and the smallest object we 
use has a radius of $R=\SI{1.03}{\um}$. The ratio $\nicefrac{2R}{\lal}\approx 
2.6$ is close to unity and the application of ray optics in our case might be 
questionable. However, previous work with our optical trap
\cite{Lakaemper2015,Lamprecht2016,Lamprecht2017} have shown that the ray 
approximation is a reasonable approach for our setup.
% In addition, one has to differentiate between quantitative and qualitative 
% analysis. For most results in our thesis we use our optical trapping setup as 
% tool for relating results qualitatively.

\section{Experimental Setup}

  (QPDs). In the top half red shading and the black lines outline the laser 
intensity profile qualitatively. In the bottom half just the most outer laser 
rays are depicted.}
  \label{fig:TO-setup}
\end{figure}

Before highlighting important parts from ray optics it is advantageous to 
understand our optical trapping setup which is based upon the work of Arthur 
Ashkin~\cite{Ashkin1978,Ashkin1987,Ashkin2002,Ashkin1986,Ashkin1992,Ashkin1997}. 
\cref{fig:TO-setup} depicts a basic schematic of the laser path from the laser 
source to the quadrant photo detectors (QPDs) in the back focal plane. A 
complete overview of our setup with a list and explanation of every used part 
is available in~\cite{Lamprecht2017}. In the following, we will highlight the 
path of the light from the laser source to the QPDs.

Our laser diode emits a tightly confined laser beam in the non-visible 
near-infrared regime with a wavelength of $\lal=\SI{785}{\nm}$ and a maximal 
power of $P=\SI{200}{\milli\watt}$. This laser profile is axisymmetric with 
respect to the light propagation direction and can be visualized with a 
rotating Gaussian bell curve (TEM$_{00}$). Next, the beam is expanded such 
that it is much larger than the opening of the microscope housing. The 
magnitude of the trapping forces are proportional to the laser intensity of the 
beam. The biggest contribution to the total trapping force stems from the outer 
parts of the beam because greater incident angles are present there. Therefore, 
the beam is broadened before guiding it to the focusing lens. The opening of 
the microscope is overfilled by the broadened beam such that the laser 
intensity is cutoff and can be approximated with a flat-top profile. Hence, 
every light ray (also the ones contributing most to the total trapping force) 
carry the same power.

The next step is the focusing of the beam with a high numerical aperture (NA) 
oil immersion lens. At the focal point, the actual trapping of the particle 
occurs. If also the position of the trapped object relative to the focal point 
is of interest and not only the trapping of particles, the laser beam needs to 
be investigated further after the trapping. The relative particle movement 
within the trap changes the path of the beam ever so slightly that this 
deflection contains the necessary information for the movement analysis. In 
order to image the movement in all three spatial directions the beam is 
collimated again by the condensor lens after it passed by the particle and is 
filtered to reduce its total intensity to prevent damage of the QPDs. Before 
the beam is focussed, it is split into two parts because the axial movement 
detection for $\ez$ (QPDz) and the in plane movement detection for $\ex$ and 
$\ey$ (QPDxy) have inherently different working principles.

If the particle moves within the trap the spot on the QPDxy will also move. By 
measuring the voltage on each quadrant of the QPDxy and summing and subtracting 
certain quadrants it is possible to retrieve the information about the movement 
in each direction separately. For the axial direction the opening of the QPDz 
is overfilled. An axial movement of the particle causes a change of total 
intensity on this QPD. By measuring the QPDz total intensity we have the 
information about the relative particle movement within the trap along the 
axial $\ez$-direction~\cite{Felgner1995a}. For a conversion of the measured 
voltage to meter the OT needs to be calibrated. The calibration process itself 
is not relevant for this thesis but is described extensively 
in~\cite{Lamprecht2017}. A discussion of different calibration options is 
available from \citeauthor{Svoboda1994}~\cite{Svoboda1994} and 
\citeauthor{Jun2004}~\cite{Jun2004}.

In the following, we will always assume water as fluid medium and silicon 
dioxide (\SiO) as particle material. All calculations are also applicable to 
other fluid-particle material combinations with adapted material parameters.

\section{Ray Optics\label{sec:TO-rayoptics}}

As mentioned before, in the regime of ray optics the propagation of light is 
visualized by single rays. The interaction of a single ray at an interface is 
then studied geometrically. The defining property for ray optics is the so 
called refractive index $\refraction$. Light travels at the speed of light 
$\tilde{\speed}=\SI{299792458}{\m\per\s}$ in vacuum. Outside of vacuum the 
speed of light has a smaller magnitude. The refractive index relates the speed 
of light of vacuum $\tilde{\speed}$ to any other material 
$\tilde{\speed}_{\Box}$
\begin{equation}
  \tilde{\speed}_{\Box} = \frac{\tilde{\speed}}{n_{\Box}}.
  \label{eq:TO-lightspeed}
\end{equation}
Since there is nothing faster than the speed of light in vacuum, the refractive 
index $\refraction$ cannot be smaller than 1. This index is not constant for 
one material but a function of the wavelength $\lal$. Additionally, the 
refractive index is in general a complex quantity
\begin{equation}
  \refraction\geq 1 \quad \wedge \quad \refraction \coloneqq 
  \refraction(\lal) = \refraction(\lal) - \iu \tilde{\refraction}(\lal)
  \label{eq:TO-refractive-index}
\end{equation}
where $\tilde{\refraction}$ is called the extinction 
coefficient~\cite{Jackson2013}. The absorption coefficient~\cite{Hecht2017}
\begin{equation}
  \alpha = \frac{4\pi f \tilde{\refraction}}{\tilde{\speed}} = 
  \frac{4\pi}{\lal}\tilde{\refraction}\quad\text{with}\quad\lal=\frac{\tilde{\speed}}{f}
  \label{eq:TO-alpha}
\end{equation}
converts the dimensionless quantity $\tilde{\refraction}$ into a physical 
parameter with unit \si{\per\meter} and is a measure for the absorbed energy; a 
higher value implies higher absorption per traveled distance. After a distance 
of $\alpha\left(\lal\right)^{-1}$ the ray intensity with wavelength $\lal$ 
decreased by 63.2\%. \Cref{fig:TO-n_water} depicts $n$ and $\alpha$ of water 
for different wavelengths $\lal$. Whereas the real part of the refractive index 
is about constant for $\lal > \SI{400}{\nm}$, the absorption coefficient 
changes its value over 4 orders of magnitude in the same interval.

\begin{figure}[tbp]
  \centering
  % \input{\relPath/10_Figures/TikZ/n_water.tikz}
  \includegraphics[]{/n_water.eps}
  \caption{Index of refraction $n$ and absorption coefficient $\alpha$ for 
  water over the wavelength $\lal$. Data taken from 
\cite{Hale1973,Segelstein1981}.}
  \label{fig:TO-n_water}
\end{figure}


Any ray of any wavelength is attenuated when propagating through a medium. The 
\emph{Beer-Lambert Law}
\begin{equation}
  \intensity(s) = \intensity_{0}\exp(-\alpha s)
  \label{eq:TO-beer-lambert}
\end{equation}
captures the change of intensity while moving along the path $s$ where 
$\intensity_{0}$ is the intensity at the start of the path. E.g. in a depth of 
approximately \SI{1}{\kilo\meter} it is completely dark in the ocean because 
all the intensity of the sunlight is attenuated there.

\begin{figure}[tbp]
  \centering
  % \input{\relPath/10_Figures/TikZ/Snell.tikz}
  \includegraphics[]{/Snell.pdf}
  \caption{Visualization of Snell's Law for rays at an interface of two media 
  with different refractive indices $\refraction_{\Box}$.}
  \label{fig:TO-Snell}
\end{figure}

With the real part of the complex refractive index $\refraction(\lal)$, it is 
possible to define the most important relation in the ray optics regime: 
\emph{Snell's Law} (see also \cref{fig:TO-Snell}) is
\begin{equation}
  \nf\,\sin\incident = \ns\,\sin\transmitted.
  \label{eq:TO-Snell}
\end{equation}
This law connects the angle of incident $\incident$ with the transmitted angle 
$\transmitted$ at an interface of two different media with refractive indices 
$\nf$ and $\ns$, respectively. This law is based on the fact that a ray of 
light travels on the fastest and not the shortest path between two 
points~\cite{Born1980Ch3}. The angle of the reflected ray is equal to the 
incident angle ($\reflected=\incident$).

Another angle of special interest is the angle of total internal reflection 
% $\theta_{\MR{TIR}}$
\begin{equation}
  \theta_{\MR{TIR}}=\sin^{-1} \frac{\ns}{\nf}
  % \incident \quad \text{}\forall\quad \frac{\nf}{\ns}\,\sin\incident > 1.
  \label{eq:TO-TIR}
\end{equation}
For incident angles of this magnitude or greater 
($\incident\geq\theta_{\MR{TIR}}$), no ray is transmitted into the other 
medium; only reflection is occurring. It can only occur if the index of 
refraction of the incident medium is greater than the transmitted medium 
($\nf>\ns$ in \cref{fig:TO-Snell}) otherwise the ratio $\sfrac{\nf}{\ns}$ of 
\cref{eq:TO-TIR} is always smaller than unity and there is physically no total 
internal reflection possible.

% The other angle of special interest is the so called \emph{Brewster Angle} 
% $\theta_{\MR{B}}$
% \begin{equation}
  % \theta_{\MR{B}} = \tan^{-1}\left( \frac{\ns}{\nf} \right).
  % \label{eq:TO-brewster}
% \end{equation}
% At this angle there does not occur an reflection and hence all the intensity is 
% transmitted.

\cref{eq:TO-Snell} calculates in which direction a ray will travel after an 
interface of two media. The intensity amplitude of the reflected and 
transmitted rays can be computed with the so called \emph{Fresnel 
Equations}~\cite{Jackson2013,Born1980Ch1}. Although we think of light as rays, 
the theory behind those equations is based on the electromagnetic wave 
character of light. For time harmonic electromagnetic waves the amplitude of 
the incident electric wave vector $\vb{E}_{\MR{i}}$ to the transmitted electric 
wave vector $\vb{E}_{\MR{t}}$ and to the reflected electric wave vector 
$\vb{E}_{\MR{r}}$ is related by $\fresnelr_{i}$ and $\fresnelt_{i}$ at the 
interface of the two media
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
  \vb{E}_{\MR{r}} & =\fresnelr_{i}\,\vb{E}_{\MR{i}} \\[3mm]
  \vb{E}_{\MR{t}} & =\fresnelt_{i}\,\vb{E}_{\MR{i}}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where the subscript $i$ can either be $i=\MR{p}$ for p-polarized light or 
$i=\MR{s}$ for s-polarized light~\cite{Jackson2013,Born1980Ch1}. ``s'' and 
``p'' stand for the German words ``parallel'' (parallel) and ``senkrecht'' 
(perpendicular), respectively. They refer to the orientation of the incident 
electric field $\vb{E}_{\MR{i}}$ to the plane of incident. For the special 
cases of ``p'' and ``s'' polarized light the Fresnel coefficient with the 
assumption that both media are non-magnetic ($\mu_{\MR{f}} = \mu_{\MR{s}} = 
\mu_{0} = 1$)~\cite{Born1980Ch1} are
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
  \fresnelr_{\MR{s}} & =
  \frac{2\,\nf\,\cos\incident}{\nf\,\cos\incident + \ns\,\cos\reflected} 
  \label{eq:TO-fresnel-rs}\\[3mm]
  \fresnelt_{\MR{s}} & = \frac{\nf\,\cos\incident - 
  \ns\,\cos\reflected}{\nf\,\cos\incident + \ns\,\cos\reflected} 
  \label{eq:TO-fresnel-ts}\\[3mm]
  \fresnelr_{\MR{p}} & =
  \frac{2\,\nf\,\cos\incident}{\ns\,\cos\incident + \nf\,\cos\reflected} 
  \label{eq:TO-fresnel-rp}\\[3mm]
  \fresnelt_{\MR{p}} & = \frac{\ns\,\cos\incident - 
  \nf\,\cos\reflected}{\ns\,\cos\incident + \nf\,\cos\reflected}.
\label{eq:TO-fresnel-tp}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
The Fresnel coefficients relate the amplitudes of the incident electrical field 
to the transmitted and reflected electrical field. In general, the sum of 
$\fresnelr_{i}$ and $\fresnelt_{i}$ does not add up to one.

For \cref{sec:TO-temperature}, it is necessary to know how much of the incident 
power $P_{\MR{i}}$ is transmitted and how much is reflected. The power 
$P=\intensity A$ is a product of the intensity $\intensity$ and the area $A$ 
the power is acting on. The intensity is defined as the time-average of the 
Ponyting vector $\vb{S}$
\begin{equation}
  \intensity = \timeaverage{\abs{\vb{S}}} = 
  \timeaverage{\abs{\vb{E}_{0}\times\vb{H}_{0}}} = 
  \frac{1}{2}\,\frac{\refraction}{Z_{0}}\,\abs{\vb{E}_{0}}^{2} = 
  \frac{1}{2}\,\refraction\,c\epsilon_{0}\,\abs{\vb{E}_{0}}^{2}
\end{equation}
where $Z_{0}$ is the electrical impedance of free space and $\epsilon_{0}$ is 
the vacuum permittivity. With 
\cref{eq:TO-fresnel-rs,eq:TO-fresnel-ts,eq:TO-fresnel-rp,eq:TO-fresnel-tp} the 
scaling of the electrical field at the interface is defined. With the relation 
for the distance $w$ of two parallel rays at the interface (see also 
\cref{fig:TO-Snell})
\begin{equation}
  w = \frac{w_{\MR{i}}}{\cos\incident} = \frac{w_{\MR{r}}}{\cos\reflected} = 
  \frac{w_{\MR{t}}}{\cos\transmitted}
  \label{eq:TO-area}
\end{equation}
and the scaling of the power
\begin{equation}
  P = \intensity A \propto \refraction\,\abs{\vb{E}_{0}}^{2}A \propto
  \refraction\,\abs{\vb{E}_{0}}^{2}w_{\Box}
\end{equation}
one can calculate the reflectance $\fresnelR_{i}$ as the ratio of the reflected 
power $P_{\MR{r}}$ to the incident power $P_{\MR{i}}$ as
\begin{equation}
  \fresnelR_{i} = \frac{P_{\MR{r}}}{P_{\MR{i}}} = 
  \frac{\intensity_{\MR{r}}\,\nf\,w_{\MR{r}}}{\intensity_{\MR{i}}\,\nf\,w_{\MR{i}}} 
  =\frac{\abs{\fresnelr_{i}\,\vb{E}_{0}}^{2}}{\abs{\vb{E}_{0}}^{2}} = 
  \fresnelr_{i}^{2}
  \label{eq:TO-fresnelR}
\end{equation}
where again the italic $i$ in the subscript ($\Box_{i}$) indicates the 
polarization. Similarly one finds the transmittance $\fresnelT_{i}$ as
\begin{equation}
  \fresnelT_{i} = \frac{P_{\MR{t}}}{P_{\MR{i}}} = 
  \frac{\intensity_{\MR{t}}\,\ns\,w_{\MR{t}}}{\intensity_{\MR{i}}\,\nf\,w_{\MR{i}}} 
  =\frac{\abs{\fresnelt_{i}\,\vb{E}_{0}}^{2}}{\abs{\vb{E}_{0}}^{2}}\,\frac{\ns\,w_{\MR{t}}}{\nf\,w_{\MR{i}}} 
  = \fresnelt_{i}^{2}\,\frac{\ns\,\cos\transmitted}{\nf\,\cos\incident}.
  \label{eq:TO-fresnelT}
\end{equation}
For unpolarized rays one can take the arithmetic average of $\Box_{\MR{s}}$ and 
$\Box_{\MR{p}}$ polarization values. Other than the Fresnel coefficients the 
sum of the reflectance $\fresnelR$ and the transmittance $\fresnelT$ for one 
angle of incidence need to be unity
\begin{equation}
  \fresnelR + \fresnelT = 
  \frac{\fresnelR_{\MR{s}}+\fresnelR_{\MR{p}}}{2} +
  \frac{\fresnelT_{\MR{s}}+\fresnelT_{\MR{p}}}{2} = 1 
  \label{eq:TO-fresnel}
\end{equation}
because the incident power $P_{\MR{i}}$ is either reflected or transmitted
\begin{equation}
  P_{\MR{i}} = P_{\MR{r}} + P_{\MR{t}} = P_{\MR{i}}\left( \fresnelR + \fresnelT 
  \right).
\end{equation}

\section{Laser Induced Temperature Change\label{sec:TO-temperature}}

A laser is a highly focused coherent beam of electromagnetic waves of a single 
wavelength $\lal$. Intensities with the orders of 
\si{\mega\watt\per\square\meter} and more are common. For comparison, the 
average intensity of the sun on to the earth in Central Europe is about 
\SI{1.36}{\kilo\watt\per\square\meter}, and the laser of our setup has with its 
peak power of \SI{200}{\milli\watt} and a specified beam diameter of 
\SI{1}{\mm} a maximal intensity of about 
\SI{0.25}{\mega\watt\per\square\meter}. As described with the Beer-Lambert-Law
(\cref{eq:TO-beer-lambert}) some of the laser intensity is attenuated while 
traveling through a medium. The attenuation of intensity will lead to an 
increase of temperature in the absorbing medium.

The intensity of a focused laser is highest in the region of the focal point 
because all of its power is confined to a small area with a width of about one 
wavelength. Direct temperature measurements in the vicinity of the focussed 
laser are due to the microscopic region of interest up to now not possible. 
Precise knowledge of the temperature change is of interest, e.g., for the 
calibration process of the OT but also for objects that need to stay below a 
certain temperature, e.g. living cells.

In the following sections, we will first discuss the current research regarding 
temperature increase in OTs, discuss the path of a ray through the particle, 
and then motivate a temperature approximation based on simple ray optics.

\subsection{State of the Art}\label{sec:TO-state}

\cyear{Liu1995} measured the temperature dependent change in the fluorescence 
of biological cells while being trapped with a wavelength of 
$\lal=\SI{1064}{\nm}$. They found a linear relation between temperature 
increase and applied laser power of about \SI{15}{\degreeCelsius\per\watt}. In 
addition, they solved the heat problem also analytically. For that, they 
neglected the trapped object and modeled it as water because their cells of 
interest consisted mainly of water. The experiments as well as the analytical 
solution show an almost instantaneous change in temperature after the laser was 
switched on.

\cyear{Celliers2000} measured the local change in the index of refraction for 
water while being subjected to a laser with a wavelength of \SI{985}{\nm}. 
During the measurements no objects were trapped in the laser focus. They 
measured a temperature increase of \SI{4}{\degreeCelsius} with a laser power of 
\SI{55}{\milli\watt} in the focus of the laser leading to a heating coefficient 
of \SI{72}{\degreeCelsius\per\watt}. An analytical model that utilized an 
improved source term compared to \cite{Liu1995} validated their results.

\cyear{Peterman2003} measured with a OT of $\lal=\SI{1064}{\nm}$ wavelength the 
effects of the temperature increase in the vicinity of the laser focus. A 
change of temperature in the fluid will lead to a change of the fluid 
viscosity. The viscosity change alters the calibration parameters of the OT. By 
fitting the calibration parameters for different laser powers to the 
theoretical relation they found a temperature increase of roughly 
\SI{8}{\degreeCelsius\per\watt} for water as fluid medium and silica beads as 
trapped objects. More interestingly, their analytical model revealed that most 
of the heat absorption is in the fluid rather than the trapped object. In 
addition, usual glass coverslips act as fast heat conductor compared to water 
such that measurements close to the top or bottom surface of the fluid cavity 
lead to a minor temperature increase.

\cyear{Moreau2015} injected Rhodamine B (RhB) in cells to measure the 
temperature change of an OT with $\lal=\SI{800}{\nm}$ wavelength. RhB is a 
temperature sensitive dye which changes its fluorescence linearly with the 
temperature. Since they injected the RhB into the cell the measured 
temperature difference was close to the focal point. As before, the increase of 
the temperature occurred almost instantaneously and was about 
\SI{9}{\degreeCelsius\per\watt}.

Lastly, in \citeyear{Catala2017}, \cname{Catala2017} studied the effects of 
different experimental parameters (NA, material of trapped object, distance to 
coverslips, object radius) to the magnitude of the temperature increase with an 
OT of $\lal=\SI{1064}{\nm}$ wavelength. A numerical model validated their 
experimental findings. Their source term which is an extension to 
\cname{Peterman2003} took account of the NA, the finite focal spot size, and 
the wavelength of the laser itself. In agreement to the others they found the 
heat increase to be about \SI{20}{\degreeCelsius\per\watt}.

All of the aforementioned studies (see also \cref{tab:TO-heating}) validated in 
their experiments the linear relation of the applied laser power to the 
increase in temperature. Also, they showed that the temperature change occurs 
almost instantaneously and that a steady system without any further temperature 
increase is established in the range of a few \si{\ms}. In addition, they agree 
that the main absorption occurs in the fluid medium (water or glycerol) rather 
than the trapped object (polystyrene or silica) itself because the absorption 
coefficient of the fluid $\alpha_{\MR{f}}$ is greater than of the particle 
$\alpha_{\MR{s}}$. Besides \cname{Moreau2015} and \cname{Celliers2000} all 
studies operate at a wavelength of \SI{1064}{\nm}. Our OT operates at 
\SI{785}{\nm} and the absorption coefficient $\alpha_{\MR{f}}$ for this 
wavelength and for water is about one order of magnitude smaller than it is at 
\SI{1064}{\nm},
$\alpha_{\MR{f}}(\SI{785}{\nm}) \approx \SI{2.14}{\per\meter} $ and 
$\alpha_{\MR{f}}(\SI{1064}{\nm}) \approx \SI{15.4}{\per\meter} $ respectively 
(see \cref{fig:TO-n_water}).
% The magnitude of the absorption coefficient $\alpha_{\MR{f}}$ is the measure 
% for how much power gets absorbed by the fluid.
% The parameter $\alpha_{\MR{f}}$ contributes linear to the source term in the 
% heat equation.

Besides the results of \cname{Peterman2003} the measured temperature increase 
is larger for the wavelength of \SI{1064}{\nm}. The magnitudes of the 
respective absorption coefficients $\alpha_{\Box}$ 
($\nicefrac{15.4}{2.14}\approx 7.2$) suggest a seven times greater heating for 
the \SI{1064}{\nm} wavelength. However, only the results of 
\cname{Celliers2000} compared to \cname{Moreau2015} match this interpolation. 
But \cname{Celliers2000} used an inherently different method for approximating 
the temperature increase where no object was trapped during the measurement. 
Despite having non-coherent results, we take a heating value of 
\SI{10}{\degreeCelsius\per\watt} for water and our wavelength of \SI{785}{\nm} 
as given for the following section if the focus of the OT is at least 
\SI{10}{\um} away from any surrounding surface. With a peak power of 
$\SI{0.2}{\watt}$ the water temperature will not increase by more than 
\SI{2}{\degreeCelsius} for our OT setup.

\subsection[Ray Path \& absorbed Energy]{Ray Path through Particle and absorbed 
Energy}

Before approximating the heat distribution inside the trapped particle with ray 
optics, it is necessary to investigate the path of the ray through the 
particle. In \cref{fig:TO-ray_particle} a ray with power $\power{i}{1}$ is 
incident on the particle surface in point $A$. The direction of the ray is 
towards the focal point $f$ which is slightly above the middle point $M$ of the 
particle because the stable trapping position is the equilibrium of the 
trapping forces towards the point $f$, the repulsive radiation forces from the 
laser beam, and gravity. We denote the distance between the sphere center $M$ 
and the focal point $f$ with $\Rprime$. Because of the different refractive 
indices of the fluid $\nf$ and the particle $\ns$ the ray gets deflected inside 
the particle. The transmitted angle $\transmitted$ can easily be computed with 
\cref{eq:TO-Snell}. However, for that the incident angle $\incident$ must be 
known.

\begin{figure}[thp]

  \caption{Schematic of ray path through particle.}
  \label{fig:TO-ray_particle}
\end{figure}

With the convergence angle $\beta$ (see \cref{fig:TO-angles}) and the sine-law
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\sin\left( \frac{\pi}{2}-\beta \right)}{\R} = 
  \frac{\sin\incident}{\Rprime}
  \label{eq:TO-sine-law}
\end{equation}
one can compute $\incident$ as function of $\beta$. The angle $\beta$ is an 
input parameter and therefore known. The maximal convergence angle 
$\beta_{\MR{max}}$ is evaluated by the definition of the NA
\begin{equation}
  \cNA = \nf\,\sin\beta_{\MR{max}}.
  \label{eq:TO-NA}
\end{equation}
Our lens has a $\cNA$ of 1.27 and water has a refractive index of $\nf=1.33$ 
(see \cref{fig:TO-n_water}) and therefore our maximal convergence angle 
$\beta_{\MR{max}} \approx \SI{72}{\degree}$.

By knowing $\transmitted^{1}$ the path of the ray inside the particle is 
determined. At the next intersection point of the ray with the particle 
surface $N$, the ray is again partly transmitted into the fluid and partly 
reflected. Since the triangle $\bigtriangleup_{AMN}$ is an isosceles triangle 
(two sides have the same length $R$) and since per definition the reflected 
angle equals the incident angle, all internal reflection angles for one ray 
have the same magnitude ($\transmitted^{1}=\incident^{n}=\reflected^{n}$ for 
$n>1$).

Now, the respective powers of one ray can be evaluated. The ray has the 
incident power $\power{i}{1}$ with every reflection it gets split into two 
portions. With \cref{eq:TO-fresnelR,eq:TO-fresnelT,eq:TO-fresnel} the powers 
after each reflection is
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{alignat}{3}
    \power{t}{1} & = \fresnelT\left( \incident^{1} \right)\,\power{i}{1} && \\
    \power{r}{2} & = \fresnelR\left( \transmitted^{1} \right)\,\power{t}{1} && 
    = \power{i}{1}\,\fresnelT\left( \incident^{1} \right)\,
    \fresnelR\left( \transmitted^{1} \right) \\
    \power{t}{2} & = \fresnelT\left( \transmitted^{1} \right)\,\power{t}{1} && 
    = \power{i}{1}\,\fresnelT\left( \incident^{1} \right)\,
    \fresnelT\left( \transmitted^{1} \right) \\
    \power{r}{3} & = \fresnelR\left( \transmitted^{1} \right)\,\power{i}{3} && 
    = \power{i}{1}\,\fresnelT\left( \incident^{1} \right)\,
    \fresnelR^{2}\left( \transmitted^{1} \right).
\end{alignat}
\end{subequations}

If a particle is stably trapped the distance $\Rprime$ is about $\Rprime 
\approx 0.1R$~\cite{Lamprecht2017}. During the trapping process and due to 
external forces this distances changes. If the focal point is outside the 
particle, the forces from the laser beam are too small to trap objects.

\cref{fig:TO-gamma_theta} depicts the values of $\gamma$ and $\incident$, 
respectively, for different combinations of $a$ and $\beta$. As pointed out 
before, the distance $\Rprime \approx 0.1\R$. For this distance the maximal 
incident angle $\incident$ over the whole range of $\beta$ is less than 
\SI{10}{\degree}.

Finally, we can estimate the total relative absorbed energy $\Xi$ by the 
particle. \cref{eq:TO-beer-lambert} defines the intensity of a single ray after 
a distance $s$. Hence the relative absorbed intensity over this length is
\begin{equation}
  \intensity_{\MR{abs}} = \intensity_{0} \left( 1 - \exp(-\alpha_{\MR{s}}\,s) 
  \right).
    \label{eq:TO-absorbed_energy}
\end{equation}
The distance $s$ for one passage through the particle can be computed as 
function of $\beta$ as
\begin{equation}
  s\left( \beta \right)
  =
  2R\,\cos\transmitted
  =
  2R\,\cos\left\{ \transmitted\left[ \incident\left( \beta \right) \right] 
  \right\}.
    \label{eq:TO-distance_s}
\end{equation}
And the power of a ray after $j$ reflections inside the particle is
\begin{equation}
  \begin{alignedat}{3}
    \power{i}{j} &=
    \power{i}{1} \, &&
    \fresnelT_{\MR{f}\rightarrow\MR{s}}\left( \incident \right) \, &&
    \left[\fresnelR_{\MR{s}\rightarrow\MR{f}}\left( \transmitted 
    \right)\right]^{(j)}\\
    &=
    \power{i}{1} \, &&
    \fresnelT_{\MR{f}\rightarrow\MR{s}}
    \left( \incident\left( \beta \right) \right) \, &&
    \left[
      \fresnelR_{\MR{s}\rightarrow\MR{f}}
      \left( \transmitted\left( \incident\left( \beta \right) \right) \right)
  \right]^{(j)} \coloneqq \power{i}{j}\left( \beta \right)
  \end{alignedat}
  \label{eq:TO-power}
\end{equation}
where $\Box_{\MR{f}\rightarrow\MR{s}}$ indicates fluid-solid interface and 
$\Box_{\MR{s}\rightarrow\MR{f}}$ the solid-fluid interface. With 
\cref{eq:TO-absorbed_energy,eq:TO-distance_s,eq:TO-power} the relative absorbed 
energy $\Xi$ inside the particle can be approximated with $N$ discrete values
\begin{equation}
  \beta_{n} = \frac{n}{N}\,\beta_{\MR{max}}\quad\text{with}\quad 
  n\in\left\{1,2,\ldots,N\right\}.
  \label{eq:TO-beta-disc}
\end{equation}
to be
\begin{equation}
    % \intensity_{\MR{tot.,abs.}} \approx
    \Xi \approx
    \frac{2\pi}{N}
    \sum\limits_{n=1}^{N}
    \sum\limits_{m=0}^{\infty}
    \left\{ 1 - \exp\left[-\alpha_{\MR{s}}\,s\left( \beta_{n} \right) \right] 
    \right\}
    \underbrace{\power{i}{m}\left( \beta_{n} \right)}_{
    \fresnelT_{\MR{f}\rightarrow\MR{s}}\left( \beta_{n}\right) \,
    \left[\fresnelR_{\MR{s}\rightarrow\MR{f}}\left(\beta_{n}\right)\right]^{(m)}
}
  \label{eq:TO-total-absorbed}
\end{equation}
where the factor $\nicefrac{1}{N}$ is due to the assumption that each ray has 
the same incident power when hitting the particle surface and the factor $2\pi$ 
for considering the full volume of the particle. Per definition the reflectance 
$\fresnelR$ and the transmittance $\fresnelT$ and smaller than 1. This property 
as well as
\begin{equation}
  \sum\limits^{\infty}_{m=0} \Box^{m} = \frac{1}{1-\Box}
  \quad\text{for}\quad\abs{\Box} < 1
\end{equation}
can be applied to \cref{eq:TO-total-absorbed} to simplify the double sum to
\begin{equation}
  % \intensity_{\MR{tot.,abs.}} \approx
  \Xi \approx
  \frac{2\pi}{N}
  \sum\limits_{n=1}^{N}
  \fresnelT_{\MR{f}\rightarrow\MR{s}}\left( \beta_{n} \right)
  \left[ 1 - \exp\left( -\alpha_{\MR{s}}\,s\left( \beta_{n} \right) \right) 
  \right]
  \,\frac{1}{1-\fresnelR_{\MR{s}\rightarrow\MR{f}}\left( \beta_{n} \right)}.
  \label{eq:TO-total-absorbed-simp}
\end{equation}

\cref{fig:TO-fresnel} depicts the values for $\fresnelT$ and $\fresnelR$ for 
the fluid-particle interface and the particle-fluid interface. Noteworthy is 
the fact, that for the occurring incident angles $\incident \leq 
\SI{10}{\degree}$ the values of $\fresnelR$ for both interface are less than 
$3\cdot 10^{-3}$. Therefore, most of the energy is transmitted and almost none 
reflected. For example, the relative power after one internal reflection and 
for an incident angle of $\incident=\SI{10}{\degree}$ is $\approx 2.07\cdot 
10^{-3}\,\power{i}{1}$ and after two internal reflections already $\approx 
4.31\cdot 10^{-6}\,\power{i}{1}$.

\SI{2.08}{\per\meter}~\cite{Kitamura2007}.}
  \label{fig:TO-absorbed_energies}
\end{figure}

\cref{fig:TO-absorbed_energies} shows the relative absorbed energy $\Xi$ inside 
a particle for various radii $R$ and distances $\Rprime$. As 
\cref{fig:TO-fresnel} already suggested only a little fraction of the trapping 
energy is absorbed by the particle itself.

\subsection{Ray Optics Heat Approximation}

With the knowledge of the relative absorbed energy $\Xi$ by the particle, we 
solve the heat equation for the particle
\begin{equation}
  \laplacian{T} = \frac{1}{\kappa} \pdv{T}{t} - \frac{q}{K}
  \label{eq:TO-heat-prob}
\end{equation}
where $T$ is the temperature inside the particle, $q$ is the absorbed energy 
per unit volume, $K$ the thermal conductivity, and $\kappa$ the thermal 
diffusivity. Going further, we neglect the time-dependence $\pdv{T}{t}= 0$ 
because all publications presented in \cref{sec:TO-state} state that the 
heating occurs within \si{\ms} and the temperature does not change afterwards 
anymore \begin{equation}
  \laplacian{T} = - \frac{q}{K}.
  \label{eq:TO-heat-stat}
\end{equation}
 In addition, we assume a spherical particle and solve the problem with a 
 spherical coordinate system (see \cref{fig:TA-coordinate}) with its origin at 
 the particle center. Additionally, we take the source term $q$ to be constant 
 throughout the particle. Therefore, we neglect all partial derivatives with 
 respect to the angles $\varphi$ and $\theta$ and solve a second order ordinary 
 differential equation
 \begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{r^{2}}\pdv{r}\left( r^{2}\pdv{T}{r} \right) = - \frac{q}{K}
  \label{eq:TO-heat-spherical}
\end{equation}
with only a $r$ dependence and a constant source term. We complete the problem, 
with two boundary conditions
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
  \eval{\pdv{T}{r}}_{r=0} &= 0\\[3mm]
  \eval{T}_{r=\R} &= T_{0}.
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
The first one ensures that there is no heat flux in and out of a single point, 
the origin of the particle ($r=0$). And the second boundary condition fixes the 
temperature at the surface of the particle ($r=\R$). It implies that the 
temperature at the surface of the particle is constant and is not influenced by 
the particle temperature distribution.

After two consecutive integration and the enforcement of the boundary 
conditions one finds the difference temperature to be
\begin{equation}
 \Delta T(r) = T(r) - T_{0} = \frac{q}{6K}\left(\R^2 - r^{2} \right).
  \label{eq:TO-heat-sol}
\end{equation}
The average temperature increase over the whole particle is the volume integral 
of \cref{eq:TO-heat-sol}
\begin{equation}
  \overline{\Delta T} = \frac{1}{V}\int_{V}\Delta T(r) \dd{V} = 
  \frac{1}{15}\,\frac{q}{K}\,R^{2}.
  \label{eq:TO-heat-avg}
\end{equation}
This can be further simplified since $q$ is the absorbed energy per unit volume
\begin{equation}
  q = \frac{\Xi\,P}{V} = \frac{3}{4}\,\frac{\Xi\,P}{\pi\,\R^{3}}
\end{equation}
where $P$ is the incident power of the laser and $V$ the volume of the 
particle. Finally, the average temperature increase of the spherical particle 
is
\begin{equation}
  \overline{\Delta T} = \frac{1}{20\,\pi}\,\frac{\Xi\,P}{\R\,K}.
  \label{eq:TO-heat-sol-simp}
\end{equation}
Interestingly, \cref{eq:TO-heat-sol-simp} seems to scale with $\propto 
\nicefrac{1}{\R}$. However, the relative total absorbed energy $\Xi$ is also 
dependent on $\R$ because the travelled distance of a ray within the 
particle $s$ increases with the particle size linearly. But $\Xi$ scales with 
$\left[  1-\exp\left( -\alpha_{\MR{f}}\,\R \right)\right]$ and therefore the 
average difference temperature $\overline{\Delta T}$ is proportional to 
$\nicefrac{\left[ 1-\exp\left( -\alpha_{\MR{f}}\,\R \right) \right]}{\R}$. This 
seems counter-intuitive, that a bigger particle size lead to less temperature 
increase. But it only holds for the average temperature difference 
$\overline{\Delta T}$, the maximal temperature distribution $T\vert_{r=0}$ 
(\cref{eq:TO-heat-sol}) increases with the particle size 
($T\vert_{r=0}\propto\R^{2}$).

  \caption{$\overline{\Delta T}$ of \cref{eq:TO-heat-sol-simp} for various 
  laser powers $P$ and particle radii $R$;

  \label{fig:TO-dT}
\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:TO-dT} depicts the average difference temperature for various 
combinations of laser power $P$ and particle radius $R$. With the information 
given in the aforementioned experimental studies regarding the heating by the 
laser and these ray optics motivated results for the heat distribution inside 
the particle, we conclude that the increase in temperature around and inside 
the particle for our setup is less than \SI{2}{\degreeCelsius} with the applied 
laser power in the low \si{\milli\watt} range. The main part is by the 
absorption of the fluid around the particle \begin{equation}
  \Delta T_{\MR{fluid}}
  \leq
  \SI{0.2}{\watt}\cdot\SI{10}{\celsius\per\watt}
  =
  \SI{2}{\celsius}
\end{equation}
with a maximal available laser power of \SI{200}{\milli\watt} for our setup and 
the \SiO particles gets only further heated by values smaller than 
\SI{70}{\milli\celsius}.

Having established an upper bound for the laser induced temperature increase, 
we can estimate the effects of the temperature increase to the absolute value 
of a measured force with the OT. The parameter that changes the most by a 
change in the temperature is the dynamic viscosity $\muef$ of the fluid. The 
viscosity is in general a function of the temperature $\muef\coloneqq\muef(T)$. 
For our calibration routine the absolute measured force of the OT scales with 
square root of the fluid viscosity ($\abs{\vb{\force}}\propto\sqrt{\muef}$). 
For the range of \SIrange{20}{30}{\degreeCelsius} the dynamic viscosity of 
water (exact formula from \cite{Peterman2003}) can be linearly approximated 
with
\begin{equation}
  \muef(T) = 8.9086\cdot 10^{-4} -2.0277\cdot10^{-5} (T-25).
  \label{eq:TO-viscosity}
\end{equation}
Temperature deviations of $\SI{25}{\degreeCelsius}\pm\SI{2}{\degreeCelsius}$ 
lead to force magnitude errors of less than $\pm$2.5\%. This percentage is 
acceptable small such that we neglect the temperature induced viscosity change 
and use the ambient room temperature as reference.

\section{Optical Position Detection\label{sec:TO-QPD}}

Besides trapping objects, the OT can also measure the relative movement of the 
trapped object within the trap. After a calibration of the OT, it is possible 
to convert the movement into the physical unit of meter and then also convert 
it into a force with unit Newton. Besides tracking the movement visually with, 
e.g., a high-speed camera, the most common approach is to utilize QPDs. The 
latter is superior to the camera because higher sampling rates are easily to 
achieve, less data is produced during the measurement and a full three 
dimensional resolution is possible.

In order to do so, the laser beam must be collimated after the object trapping 
region and then focussed with separate lenses onto two QPDs (see 
\cref{fig:TO-setup}). While the laser beam is focussed within the aperture of 
the QPD for the in-plane $xy$-direction (QPDxy), the beam is focussed to 
overfill the QPD aperture for the $z$-direction. For all measurements, where 
the measured signals of the QPDs needs to be converted to meter, it is crucial 
to operate in the so-called \emph{linear regime} of the QPD. In the following, 
we will show what the linear regime is.

A QPD consists of a diode divided into four separate regions. Each of the four 
diodes measures the intensity of light on its respective area and returns a 
measure in voltage. The QPD has an aperture opening radius $R_{\MR{QPD}}$. 
\cref{fig:TO-QPD} is a schematic of the QPDxy where the focussed laser spot 
midpoint $M$ is at $x=x_{0}$ and $y=y_{0}$ and the radius of the laser spot is 
about $\sfrac{1}{5}\,R_{\MR{QPD}}$~\cite{Lamprecht2017}.

The normalized intensity distribution of the laser can be modeled as
\begin{equation}
  \tilde{\intensity} = \tilde{\intensity}(x, y) = 
  \frac{1}{2\pi\,R_{\MR{spot}}^{2}}\,\exp\left[ 
  -\frac{1}{2}\,\frac{(x-x_{0})^{2} + (y - y_{0})^{2}}{R_{\MR{spot}}^{2}} 
\right]
    \label{eq:TO-intensity}
\end{equation}
where the radius of the spot is $R_{\MR{spot}}=\sfrac{\RA}{5}$ and the property 
\begin{equation}
  \int\limits_{\dd{A}}\tilde{\intensity}\dd{A} = 1
\end{equation}
holds.

  \caption{Sketch of quadrant photo detectors for $x$-$y$ detection with the 
  center of the laser image $M$ at $(x_{0}, y_{0})$.}
  \label{fig:TO-QPD}
\end{figure}

The measured voltage $V_{i}$ per quadrant is proportional to the received 
power. The received power per quadrant is the surface integral of the laser 
intensity. The four separate voltages can be evaluated with four integrals over 
the respective areas of the quadrants
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
  V_{\MR{1}} & \propto \int_{0}^{\sfrac{\pi}{2}}\int_{0}^{\RA}
  \tilde{\intensity}\left( r\cos\varphi, r\sin\varphi 
  \right)\,r\,\dd{r}\dd{\varphi}
  \label{eq:TO-V1}
  \\[3mm]
  V_{\MR{2}} & \propto \int_{\sfrac{\pi}{2}}^{\pi}\int_{0}^{\RA}
  \tilde{\intensity}\left(r\cos\varphi, 
  r\sin\varphi\right)\,r\,\dd{r}\dd{\varphi}
  \label{eq:TO-V2}
  \\[3mm]
  V_{\MR{3}} & \propto \int_{\pi}^{\sfrac{3\pi}{2}}\int_{0}^{\RA}
  \tilde{\intensity}\left(r\cos\varphi, 
  r\sin\varphi\right)\,r\,\dd{r}\dd{\varphi}
  \label{eq:TO-V3}
  \\[3mm]
  V_{\MR{4}} & \propto \int_{\sfrac{3\pi}{2}}^{2\pi}\int_{0}^{\RA}
  \tilde{\intensity}\left(r\cos\varphi, 
  r\sin\varphi\right)\,r\,\dd{r}\dd{\varphi}
  \label{eq:TO-V4}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where we used polar integration and polar coordinates $x=r\cos\varphi$ and 
$y=r\sin\varphi$.

right plot is $V_{1}$, top left $V_{2}$, bottom left $V_{3}$, bottom right 
$V_{4}$.}
  \label{fig:TO-quadrant_Intensity}
\end{figure}

If the particle moves within the trap, the center of the laser image $M$ on the 
QPDxy also moves. \cref{fig:TO-quadrant_Intensity} shows the intensity per 
quadrant for different center positions. As expected, each quadrant is 
measuring the highest intensity whenever most of the laser image is over the 
respective area.

With these four separate values for $V_{1}$ through $V_{4}$, one can create a 
measure that is proportional to the movement of the laser image center $M$ 
along the $\ex$- and $\ey$-direction, respectively. These measures are 
additions and subtractions of the quadrants along one direction
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
  V_{\MR{x}} & = \left( V_{\MR{1}}+V_{\MR{4}} \right) - \left( V_{\MR{2}} + 
  V_{\MR{3}}  \right)
  \label{eq:TO-Vx} \\
  V_{\MR{y}} & = \left( V_{\MR{1}}+V_{\MR{2}} \right) - \left( V_{\MR{3}} + 
  V_{\MR{4}}  \right)
  \label{eq:TO-Vy} \\
  V_{\MR{t}} & = V_{\MR{1}}+V_{\MR{2}} + V_{\MR{3}} + V_{\MR{4}}.
  \label{eq:TO-Vt}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

    various positions of laser image middle point $M$. The dotted horizontal 
    lines are at $y=\sfrac{-0.6}{R_{\MR{QPD}}}$, $y=\sfrac{0}{R_{\MR{QPD}}}$, 
  and $y=\sfrac{0.6}{R_{\MR{QPD}}}$ respectively.}
  \label{fig:TO-QPDs}
 \end{figure}

As for the measured intensity per quadrant, the measured values are highest if 
the laser image is over the respective quadrants (see \cref{fig:TO-QPDs}). 
However, since $V_{\MR{x}}$ and $V_{\MR{y}}$ are composed by addition and 
subtraction of the strictly positive values $V_{i}$ the magnitude can now also 
be negative.

In \cref{fig:TO-voltages_over_x} the three measures are plotted over $x_{0}$ 
for three fixed values of $y_{0}$. This plot looks the same if $x_{0}$ is fixed 
and $y_{0}$ is the changing variable. Additionally the curves $V_{\MR{x}}$ and 
$V_{\MR{y}}$ change their behavior. There is a linear region for which a small 
movement of the laser image middle point $M$ is converted into a proportional 
change in the measured intensity on the QPD. However, this linear regime from 
$-0.15\,R_{\MR{QPD}}$ to $0.15\,R_{\MR{QPD}}$ is rather small. Therefore, it is 
very important to check and adjust the laser spot center position $M$ to be in 
the middle of the QPD before each measurement to ensure interpretability of the 
results.

Noteworthy is that for values of $\sfrac{\abs{x_{0}}}{R_{\MR{QPD}}} > 0.5$ a 
further outwards movement does not lead to an increase of the respective 
measure but to a decrease. If just one of the voltages, here $V_{\MR{y}}$, is 
taken into account then this decrease ($\sfrac{x_{0}}{R_{\MR{QPD}} > 0.5}$) is 
not distinguishable from the increase coming from the middle 
($\sfrac{x_{0}}{R_{\MR{QPD}} < 0.5}$). However, by also looking at the 
evolution of $V_{\MR{t}}$ it is possible to identify in which direction the 
laser image is moving on the QPD because this measure does not change its 
magnitude for $\abs{x_{0}} < 0.5\,R_{\MR{QPD}} $.
