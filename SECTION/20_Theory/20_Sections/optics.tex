The interaction of light with any other object is described best with a set of 
equations called the Maxwell equations. This set of equations fully capture and 
describes the electromagnetic wave nature of light. It relates point wise the 
electric wave vector $\vb{E}$, the magnetic induction $\vb{B}$, the electric 
current density $\vb{j}$, the electric displacement $\vb{D}$, and the magnetic 
vector $\vb{H}$ with each other for objects where the physical properties are 
continuous in the neighbourhood of the point of interest~\cite{Born1980Ch1}
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
    \curl{\vb{H}} - \frac{1}{c}\pdv{t}\vb{D} &=\frac{4\pi}{c}\vb{j} 
    \label{eq:Th-ampere} \\
    \curl{\vb{E}} - \frac{1}{c}\pdv{t}\vb{B} &=  0
    \label{eq:Th-faraday} \\
    \div{\vb{D}} &= 4\pi\rho_{\MR{E}}
    \label{eq:Th-gauss} \\
    \div{\vb{B}} &= 0
    \label{eq:Th-gauss-mag}
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}
with $c$ being the speed of light and $\rho_{\MR{E}}$ the total electric charge 
density. Although, 
\cref{eq:Th-ampere,eq:Th-faraday,eq:Th-gauss,eq:Th-gauss-mag} describe the 
behavior of light fully, it is often more convenient to think of light as a 
collection of single rays. In the limit of a vanishing small light wavelengths 
$\lambda_{\text{light}}$ compared to the object size $R$, the approximation of 
light as single rays is valid~\cite{Born1980Ch3}. This branch of describing the 
propagation of light is called -- amongst others -- \emph{Ray Optics}.

Our laser has a wavelength of $\lal=\SI{785}{\nm}$ and the smallest object we 
use has a radius of $R=\SI{1.03}{\um}$. The ratio $\sfrac{2R}{\lal}\approx 2.6$ 
is close to unity and the application of ray optics in our case might be 
questionable. However, previous works with our optical trap
\cite{Lakaemper2015,Lamprecht2016,Lamprecht2017} have shown that the ray 
approximation is a reasonable approach in our case. In addition, one has to 
differentiate between quantitative and qualitative analysis. In all here 
presented results we use our optical trapping setup as tool for relating 
results qualitatively.

\section{Experimental Setup}

  \caption{Schematic of light path from laser head to quadrant photo detectors. 
  In the top half sketch red shading and the black lines the laser intensity 
profile qualitatively. In the bottom half just the outer most laser rays are 
depicted.}
  \label{fig:Th-setup}
\end{figure}

Before highlighting important parts from ray optics it is advantageous to 
understand our optical trapping setup which is based upon the work of Arthur 
Ashkin~\cite{Ashkin1978,Ashkin1987,Ashkin2002,Ashkin1986,Ashkin1992,Ashkin1997}. 
\cref{fig:Th-setup} depicts a basic schematic of the laser path from the laser 
source to the quadrant photo detectors (QPDs) in the back focal plane. A 
complete overview of our setup with a list and explanation of every used part 
is available in~\cite{Lamprecht2017}.

Our laser diode emits a tightly confined laser beam in the near-infrared regime 
(non-visible) with a wavelength of $\lal=\SI{785}{\nm}$ and a maximal power of 
$P=\SI{200}{\milli\watt}$ and with a transverse electromagnetic mode of order 
00 (TEM$_{00}$). This laser profile is axisymmetric to the light propagation 
direction and can be visualized with a rotating Gaussian bell curve. Next, the 
beam is expanded such that it is much larger than the opening of the microscope 
housing. The magnitude of the trapping forces are proportional to the laser 
intensity of the beam. The biggest contribution to the total force stems from 
the outer parts of the beam. Therefore, it is advantageous to broaden the beam 
before guiding it to the focusing lens. The opening of the microscope is 
overfilled by the broadened beam and the laser intensity after this cutoff can 
be approximated with a flat-top profile. Hence, every light wave (also the ones 
contributing most to the total trapping force) carries the same intensity.

The next step is the focusing of the beam with a high numerical aperture (NA) 
oil immersion lens. Here, the actual trapping of the particle occurs. If more 
than just the trapping of particles is of interest, the beam needs to be 
investigated further. The relative movement of the particle within the trap 
contains the necessary information. In order to image the movement in the $\ex$ 
and $\ey$ direction the beam is collimated again by the condensor lens after it 
passed the particle and filtered to reduce its total intensity to prevent 
damage of the QPDs. Before the beam is focussed, it is split into two because 
the axial movement detection for $\ez$ and the in plane movement detection for 
$\ex$ and $\ey$ have inherently different working principles.

If the particle moves within the trap the spot on the QPDxy will also move. By 
measuring the voltage on each quadrant of the QPDxy and summing and subtracting 
certain quadrants it is possible to retrieve the information about the movement 
in each direction separately. For the axial direction the opening of the QPDz 
is overfilled. An axial movement of the particle causes a change of total 
intensity on this QPD. By measuring the QPDz total intensity we have the 
information about the relative movement of the particle within the trap. After 
the calibration of the OT the measured voltages that are proportional to the 
particle movement can be converted to the physical unit meter. The calibration 
process itself is not relevant for this thesis but is available 
here~\cite{Lamprecht2017}. An discussion of different calibration options is 
available from \citeauthor{Svoboda1994}~\cite{Svoboda1994} and 
\citeauthor{Jun2004}~\cite{Jun2004}.

\section{Ray Optics\label{sec:Th-rayoptics}}

As said before, in the regime of ray optics the propagation of light is 
visualized by single rays. The interaction of a single ray at an interface is 
then studied geometrically. The defining property for these kind of 
investigations is the so called refractive index $\refraction$. Light travels 
in vacuum at speed of light $c=\SI{299792458}{\m\per\s}$. In other mediums than 
vacuum the speed of light has a different (smaller) magnitude. The refractive 
index relates the speed of light of vacuum $c$ to any other material $c_{\Box}$
\begin{equation}
  c_{\Box} = \frac{c}{n}.
  \label{eq:Th-lightspeed}
\end{equation}
Since there is nothing faster than the speed of light, the refractive index 
$\refraction$ cannot be smaller than 1. This index is not constant for one 
material but a function of the wavelength $\lambda$. Additionally, the 
refractive is in general a complex quantity
\begin{equation}
  \refraction\geq 1 \quad \wedge \quad \refraction \coloneqq 
  \refraction(\lambda) = \refraction(\lambda) - \iu k(\lambda)
  \label{eq:Th-refractive-index}
\end{equation}
where $k$ is called the extinction coefficient~\cite{Jackson2013}. 
\Cref{fig:Th-n_water} depicts $n$ and $k$ of water for different wavelengths 
$\lambda$. Whereas the real part of \cref{eq:Th-refractive-index} is about 
constant for $\lambda > \SI{400}{\nm}$, the complex part changes its magnitude 
over 4 orders of magnitude in the same interval.

\begin{figure}[]
  \centering
  % \input{\relPath/10_Figures/TikZ/n_water.tikz}
  \includegraphics[]{Plots/cache/n_water.eps}
  \caption{Index of refraction $n$ and extinction coefficient $k$ for water 
  over wavelength $\lambda$. Data taken from \cite{Hale1973,Segelstein1981}.}
  \label{fig:Th-n_water}
\end{figure}


The absorption coefficient~\cite{Hecht2017}
\begin{equation}
  \alpha = \frac{4\pi f k}{c} = \frac{4\pi}{\lambda}k
  \label{eq:Th-alpha}
\end{equation}
converts the dimensionless quantity $k$ into a physical parameter with unit 
\si{\per\meter}. Any ray of any wavelength is attenuated when propagating 
through a medium. The \emph{Beer-Lambert Law}
\begin{equation}
  \intensity(s) = \intensity_{0}\exp(-\alpha s)
  \label{eq:Th-beer-lambert}
\end{equation}
captures the change of intensity while moving along the path $s$ where 
$\intensity_{0}$ is the intensity at the start. E.g. in a depth of 
approximately \SI{1}{\kilo\meter} it is completely dark in the ocean because 
all the intensity of the sunlight is attenuated there.

\begin{figure}[tbp]
  \centering
  % \input{\relPath/10_Figures/TikZ/Snell.tikz}
  \includegraphics[]{Plots/cache/Snell.pdf}
  \caption{Visualization of \emph{Snell's Law} for rays at an interface of two 
  media with different refractive indices $\refraction_{\Box}$.}
  \label{fig:Th-Snell}
\end{figure}

With the real part of the complex refractive index, it is possible to define 
the most important relation in the ray optics regime. The \emph{Snell's Law} 
(see also \cref{fig:Th-Snell}) is defined as
\begin{equation}
  \nf\,\sin\incident = \ns\,\sin\transmitted.
  \label{eq:Th-Snell}
\end{equation}
It connects the angle of incident $\incident$ with the transmitted angle 
$\transmitted$ at an interface of two different media with refractive indices 
$\ns$ and $\nf$, respectively. This law is based on the fact that a ray of 
light travels on the fastest path (not the shortest) between two 
points~\cite{Born1980Ch3}. The angle of the reflected ray is equal to the 
incident angle ($\reflected=\incident$).

There is one more angle of special interest. It is the angle of total internal 
reflection $\theta_{\MR{TIR}}$
\begin{equation}
  \theta_{\MR{TIR}}=\incident \quad\forall\quad \frac{\nf}{\ns}\,\sin\incident 
  > 1.
  \label{eq:Th-TIR}
\end{equation}
For incident angles of this magnitude or greater 
($\incident\geq\theta_{\MR{TIR}}$), no ray is transmitted into the other 
medium. This can only occur if the index of refraction of the incident medium 
is greater than the transmitted medium ($\nf>\ns$ in \cref{fig:Th-Snell}) 
otherwise the ratio $\sfrac{\nf}{\ns}$ of \cref{eq:Th-TIR} is always smaller 
than unity and there is physically no total internal reflection possible.

% The other angle of special interest is the so called \emph{Brewster Angle} 
% $\theta_{\MR{B}}$
% \begin{equation}
  % \theta_{\MR{B}} = \tan^{-1}\left( \frac{\ns}{\nf} \right).
  % \label{eq:Th-brewster}
% \end{equation}
% At this angle there does not occur an reflection and hence all the intensity is 
% transmitted.

So far, \cref{eq:Th-Snell} calculates in which direction a ray will travel 
after an interface of two media. The amplitude of the reflected and transmitted 
rays can be computed with the so called \emph{Fresnel 
Equations}~\cite{Jackson2013,Born1980Ch1}. Although we think of light as rays, 
the theory behind those equations is based on the electromagnetic wave 
character of light. For time harmonic electromagnetic waves the amplitude of 
the incident electric wave vector $\vb{E}_{\MR{i}}$ to the transmitted 
$\vb{E}_{\MR{t}}$ and to the reflected $\vb{E}_{\MR{t}}$ electric wave vector 
is related by $\fresnelr_{i}$ and $\fresnelt_{i}$
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
  \vb{E}_{\MR{r}} & =\fresnelr_{i}\,\vb{E}_{\MR{i}} \\[3mm]
  \vb{E}_{\MR{t}} & =\fresnelt_{i}\,\vb{E}_{\MR{i}}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where the subscript $i$ can either be $i=\MR{p}$ for p-polarized light or 
$i=\MR{s}$ for s-polarized light~\cite{Jackson2013,Born1980Ch1}. ``s'' and 
``p'' stand for the German words ``parallel'' (parallel) and ``senkrecht'' 
(perpendicular), respectively. They refer to the to the orientation of the 
incident electric field $\vb{E}_{\MR{i}}$ to the plane of incident. For the 
special cases of ``p'' and ``s'' polarized light the Fresnel coefficient with 
the assumption that both media are non-magnetic ($\mu_{\MR{f}} = \mu_{\MR{s}} = 
\mu_{0} = 1$)~\cite{Born1980Ch1} are
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
  \fresnelr_{\MR{s}} & =
  \frac{2\,\nf\,\cos\incident}{\nf\,\cos\incident + \ns\,\cos\reflected} 
  \label{eq:Th-fresnel-rs}\\[3mm]
  \fresnelt_{\MR{s}} & = \frac{\nf\,\cos\incident - 
  \ns\,\cos\reflected}{\nf\,\cos\incident + \ns\,\cos\reflected} 
  \label{eq:Th-fresnel-ts}\\[3mm]
  \fresnelr_{\MR{p}} & =
  \frac{2\,\nf\,\cos\incident}{\ns\,\cos\incident + \nf\,\cos\reflected} 
  \label{eq:Th-fresnel-rp}\\[3mm]
  \fresnelt_{\MR{p}} & = \frac{\ns\,\cos\incident - 
  \nf\,\cos\reflected}{\ns\,\cos\incident + \nf\,\cos\reflected}.
\label{eq:Th-fresnel-tp}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
So far, the Fresnel coefficients relate the amplitudes of the incident 
electrical field to the transmitted and reflected electrical field. In general, 
the sum of $\fresnelr$ and $\fresnelt$ does not add up to unity.

For \cref{sec:Th-temperature}, it is necessary to know how much of the incident 
power $P_{\MR{i}}$ is transmitted and how much is reflected. The power 
$P=\intensity A$ is a product of the intensity $\intensity$ and the area $A$ it 
is acting on. The intensity is defined as the timeaverage of the Ponyting 
vector $\vb{S}$
\begin{equation}
  \intensity = \timeaverage{\abs{\vb{S}}} = 
  \timeaverage{\abs{\vb{E}_{0}\times\vb{H}_{0}}} = 
  \frac{1}{2}\,\frac{\refraction}{Z_{0}}\,\abs{\vb{E}_{0}}^{2} = 
  \frac{1}{2}\,\refraction\,c\epsilon_{0}\,\abs{\vb{E}_{0}}^{2}
\end{equation}
where $Z_{0}$ is the electrical impedance of free space and $\epsilon_{0}$ is 
the vacuum permittivity. With 
\cref{eq:Th-fresnel-rs,eq:Th-fresnel-ts,eq:Th-fresnel-rp,eq:Th-fresnel-tp} the 
scaling of the electrical field at the interface is defined. With the relation 
(see also \cref{fig:Th-Snell})
\begin{equation}
  w = \frac{w_{\MR{i}}}{\cos\incident} = \frac{w_{\MR{r}}}{\cos\reflected} = 
  \frac{w_{\MR{t}}}{\cos\transmitted}
  \label{eq:Th-area}
\end{equation}
and the scaling of the power
\begin{equation}
  P = \intensity A \propto \refraction\,\abs{\vb{E}_{0}}^{2}A \propto
  \refraction\,\abs{\vb{E}_{0}}^{2}w
\end{equation}
one can calculate the reflectance $\fresnelR_{i}$ as the ratio of the reflected 
power $P_{\MR{r}}$ to the incident power $P_{\MR{i}}$ as
\begin{equation}
  \fresnelR_{i} = \frac{P_{\MR{r}}}{P_{\MR{i}}} = 
  \frac{\intensity_{\MR{r}}\,\nf\,w_{\MR{r}}}{\intensity_{\MR{i}}\,\nf\,w_{\MR{i}}} 
  =\frac{\abs{\fresnelr_{i}\,\vb{E}_{0}}^{2}}{\abs{\vb{E}_{0}}^{2}} = 
  \fresnelr_{i}^{2}
\end{equation}
where again the italic $i$ in the subscript ($\Box_{i}$) is the polarization. 
Similarly one finds the transmittance $\fresnelT_{i}$ as
\begin{equation}
  \fresnelT_{i} = \frac{P_{\MR{t}}}{P_{\MR{i}}} = 
  \frac{\intensity_{\MR{t}}\,\ns\,w_{\MR{t}}}{\intensity_{\MR{i}}\,\nf\,w_{\MR{i}}} 
  =\frac{\abs{\fresnelt_{i}\,\vb{E}_{0}}^{2}}{\abs{\vb{E}_{0}}^{2}}\,\frac{\ns\,w_{\MR{t}}}{\nf\,w_{\MR{i}}} 
  = \fresnelt_{i}^{2}\,\frac{\ns\,\cos\transmitted}{\nf\,\cos\incident}.
\end{equation}
For unploarized rays one can take the arithmetic average of $\Box_{\MR{s}}$ and 
$\Box_{\MR{p}}$ polarization values. Other than the Fresnel coefficients the 
sum of the reflectance $\fresnelR$ and the transmittance $\fresnelT$ for one 
angle of incidence need to be unity
\begin{equation}
  \fresnelR + \fresnelT = 
  \frac{\fresnelR_{\MR{s}}+\fresnelR_{\MR{p}}}{2} +
  \frac{\fresnelT_{\MR{s}}+\fresnelT_{\MR{p}}}{2} = 1 
  \label{eq:Th-fresnel}
\end{equation}
because the incident power $P_{\MR{i}}$ is either reflected or transmitted
\begin{equation}
  P_{\MR{i}} = P_{\MR{r}} + P_{\MR{t}} = P_{\MR{i}}\left( \fresnelR + \fresnelT 
  \right).
\end{equation}

\section{Laser Induced Temperature Change\label{sec:Th-temperature}}

A laser is a (highly focused) coherent beam of electromagnetic waves of a 
single wavelength $\lal$. Intensities with the orders of 
\si{\mega\watt\per\square\meter} and more are common. For comparison, the 
average intensity of the sun on to the earth in Central Europe is about 
\SI{1.36}{\kilo\watt\per\square\meter}, and the laser of our setup has with its 
peak power of \SI{200}{\milli\watt} and a specified beam diameter of 
\SI{1}{\mm} a maximal intensity of about 
\SI{0.25}{\mega\watt\per\square\meter}. As described with the Beer-Lambert-Law
(\cref{eq:Th-beer-lambert}) some of the laser intensity is attenuated while 
traveling through any medium. The attenuation of intensity will lead to an 
increase of temperature in the absorbing medium.

The intensity of a focused laser is highest in the region of the focal point 
because all its power is confined to a small area. Direct temperature 
measurements in the vicinity of the laser focus are due to the microscopic 
region of interest up to now not possible. Precise knowledge of the temperature 
change is of interest, e.g., for the calibration process of the OT but also for 
objects that need to stay below a certain temperature, e.g. living cells.

In the following, we will first discuss the current research regarding 
temperature increase in OTs and then motivate a temperature approximation based 
on simple ray optics.

\subsection{State of the Art}

\cyear{Liu1995} measured the temperature dependent change in fluorescence of 
biological cells while being trapped with a wavelength of 
$\lal=\SI{1064}{\nm}$. They found a linear relation between temperature 
increase and applied laser power of about \SI{15}{\degreeCelsius\per\watt}. In 
addition, they solved the heat problem also analytically. For that, they 
neglected the trapped object and modeled as water because their cells of 
interest consist mainly out of water. The experiments as well as the 
analytical solution show an almost instantaneous change in temperature after 
the laser is switched on. \cyear{Celliers2000} measured the local change in the 
index of refraction for water while being subjected to a laser with a 
wavelength of \SI{985}{\nm}. During the measurements no objects was trapped in 
the laser focus. They measured a temperature increase of \SI{4}{\degreeCelsius} 
with a laser power of \SI{55}{\milli\watt} in the focus of the laser. An 
analytical model that utilized an improved source term compared to 
\cite{Liu1995} validated their results.

\cyear{Peterman2003} measured with a OT of \SI{1064}{\nm} wavelength the 
effects of the temperature increase in the vicinity of the laser focus. A 
change of temperature in the fluid will lead to a change of the fluid 
viscosity. The viscosity change alters the calibration parameters of the OT. By 
fitting the calibration parameters for different laser powers to the 
theoretical relation they found a temperature increase of roughly 
\SI{8}{\degreeCelsius\per\watt} for water as fluid medium and silica beads as 
trapped object. More interestingly, their analytical model revealed that most 
of the heat absorption is in the fluid rather than the trapped object. In 
addition, usual glass coverslips act as fast heat conductor compared to water 
such that measurements close to the top or bottom surface of the fluid cavity 
lead to a minor temperature increase.

\cyear{Moreau2015} injected Rhodamine B (RhB) in cells to measure the 
temperature change of an OT with \SI{800}{\nm} wavelength. RhB is a temperature 
sensitive dye which changes its fluorescence linearly with the temperature. 
Since they injected the RhB into the cell the measured temperature difference 
was around the focal point. As before, the increase of the temperature occurs 
almost instantaneously and is about \SI{9}{\degreeCelsius\per\watt}. Lastly, in 
\citeyear{Catala2017}, \cname{Catala2017} studied the effects of different 
experimental parameters (numerical aperture (NA), material of trapped object, 
distance to coverslips, object radius) to the magnitude of the temperature 
increase with an OT of \SI{1064}{\nm} wavelength. A numerical model validated 
their experimental findings. Their source term which is an extension to 
\cname{Peterman2003} takes account of the NA, the finite focal spot size, and 
the wavelength of the laser itself. In agreement to the others they found the 
heat increase to be about \SI{20}{\degreeCelsius\per\watt}.

All of the aforementioned studies (see also \cref{tab:Th-heating}) validated in 
their experiments the linear relation of the applied laser power to the 
increase in temperature. In addition, they agree that the main absorption 
occurs in the fluid medium (water or glycerol) rather than the trapped object 
(polystyrene or silica) itself because the absorption coefficient $\alpha$ is 
greater. However, as can be seen in \cref{fig:Th-n_water}, the extinction 
coefficient is dependent on the wavelength $\lal$. Besides \cite{Moreau2015} 
all studies operate at a wavelength of \SI{1064}{\nm}. Our OT operates at 
\SI{785}{\nm} and the extinction coefficient $k$ for this wavelength is about 
one order of magnitude smaller than it is at \SI{1064}{\nm},
$k(\SI{785}{\nm}) \approx 1.339\cdot 10^{-7} \rightarrow \alpha(\SI{785}{\nm}) 
\approx \SI{2.14}{\per\meter} $ and $k(\SI{1064}{\nm}) \approx 1.299\cdot 
10^{-6} \rightarrow \alpha(\SI{1064}{\nm}) \approx \SI{15.4}{\per\meter} $ 
respectively. The magnitude of the absorption coefficient $\alpha$ is the 
measure for how much intensity gets absorbed. It contributes linear in the heat 
equation.

Besides the results of \cname{Peterman2003} the measured temperature increase 
is larger for the wavelength of \SI{1064}{\nm}. The magnitudes of the 
respective absorption coefficients $\alpha$ ($\sfrac{15.4}{2.14}\approx 7.2$) 
suggest a seven times greater heating for the larger wavelength. However, only 
the results of \cname{Celliers2000} compared to \cname{Moreau2015} match this 
interpolation. But they used an inherently different method for approximating 
the temperature increase where no object was trapped during the measurement. 
Despite having non-coherent results, we take a heating value of 
\SI{10}{\degreeCelsius\per\watt} for our wavelength of \SI{785}{\nm} as given 
for the following section if the focus of the OT is at least \SI{10}{\um} away 
from any surrounding surface.
