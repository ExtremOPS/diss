  \caption{Evolution of averaged voltage differences $\DV_{y}$ (left column; 
      ARF associated) and $\DV_{z}$ (right column; AS associated) for three 
      different pulsing frequencies $\fp$ and different duty percentages at 
      $\Dy=\SI{-0.04}{\mm}$. For the first row $\fp=\sfrac{\fex}{1'000}$, for 
      the second $\fp=\sfrac{\fex}{5'000}$, and for the last row 
      $\fp=\sfrac{\fex}{10'000}$. The data per plot is normalized to the 
      maximal amplitude of the data series with a duty percentage of 100\%. The 
      vertical solid lines in the bottom left plot mark the beginning of a new 
      pulsing cycle.
